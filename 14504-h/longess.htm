  <i>Aving in convenient places of the following Treati&#383;e,
  mention'd the Motives, that induc'd me to write it, and the Scope I
  propos'd to my &#383;elf in it; I think it &#383;uperfluous to entertain
  the Reader now, with what he will meet with hereafter. And I &#383;hould
  judge it needle&#383;s, to trouble others, or my &#383;elf, with any
  thing of Preface: were it not that I can &#383;carce doubt, but this Book
  will fall into the hands of &#383;ome Readers, who being unacquainted
  with the difficulty of attempts of this nature, will think itn
  &#383;trange that I &#383;hould publi&#383;h any thing about Colours,
  without a particular Theory of them. But I dare expect that Intelligent
  and Equitable Readers will con&#383;ider on my behalf: That the
  profe&#383;&#383;ed De&#383;ign of this Treati&#383;e is to deliver
  things rather</i> Hi&#383;torical <i>than</i> Dogmatical, <i>and
  con&#383;equently if I have added divers new</i> &#383;peculative
  <i>Con&#383;iderations and hints, which perhaps may afford no
  de&#383;picable A&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance, towards the framing of a
  &#383;olid and comprehen&#383;ive Hypothe&#383;is, I have done at least
  as much as I promis'd, or as the nature of my undertaking exacted. But
  another thing there is, which if it &#383;hould be objected, I fear I
  &#383;hould not be able &#383;o ea&#383;ily to an&#383;wer it, and that
  is; That in the following treati&#383;e (e&#383;pecially in the Third
  part of it) the Experiments might have been better Mar&#383;hall'd, and
  &#383;ome of them deliver'd in fewer words. For I mu&#383;t confe&#383;s
  that this E&#383;&#383;ay was written to a private Friend, and that too,
  by &#383;natches, at &#383;everal times, and places, and (after my
  manner) in loo&#383;e &#383;heets, of which I oftentimes had not all by
  me that I had already written, when I was writing more, &#383;o that it
  needs be no wonder if all the Experiments be not rang'd to the be&#383;t
  Advantage, and if &#383;ome connections and con&#383;ecutions of them
  might ea&#383;ily have been mended. E&#383;pecially &#383;ince having
  carele&#383;&#383;ly laid by the loo&#383;e Papers, for &#383;everal
  years after they were written, when I came to put them together to
  di&#383;patch them to the Pre&#383;s, I found &#383;ome of tho&#383;e I
  reckon'd upon, to be very un&#383;ea&#383;onably wanting. And to make any
  great change in the order of the re&#383;t, was more than the Printers
  importunity, and that, of my own avocations (and perhaps al&#383;o
  con&#383;iderabler &#383;olicitations) would permit. But though &#383;ome
  few preambles of the particular Experiments might have (perchance) been
  &#383;par'd, or &#383;horten'd, if I had had all my Papers under my View
  at once; Yet in the mo&#383;t of tho&#383;e Introductory
  pa&#383;&#383;ages, the Reader will (I hope) find hints, or
  Adverti&#383;ements, as well as Tran&#383;itions. If I &#383;ometimes
  &#383;eem to in&#383;i&#383;t long upon the circum&#383;tances of a
  Tryall, I hope I &#383;hall be ea&#383;ily excu&#383;ed by tho&#383;e
  that both know, how nice divers experiments of Colours are, and
  con&#383;ider that I was not barely to</i> relate <i>them, but &#383;o as
  to teach a young Gentleman to make them. And if I was not
  &#383;ollicitous, to make a nicer divi&#383;ion of the whole
  Treati&#383;e, than into three parts, whereof the One contains &#383;ome
  Con&#383;iderations about Colours in general. The Other exhibits a
  &#383;pecimen of an Account of particular Colours, Exemplifi'd in
  Whitene&#383;s and Blackne&#383;s. And the Third promi&#383;cuous
  Experiments about the remaining Colours (e&#383;pecially Red) in order to
  a Theory of them. If, I &#383;ay, I contented my &#383;elf with this
  ea&#383;ie Divi&#383;ion of my Di&#383;cour&#383;e, it was perhaps
  becau&#383;e I did not think it &#383;o nece&#383;&#383;ary to be Curious
  about the Method or Contrivance of a Treati&#383;e, wherein I do not
  pretend to pre&#383;ent my Reader with a compleat Fabrick, or &#383;o
  much as Modell; but only to bring in Materials proper for the Building;
  And if I did not well know how Ingenious the Curio&#383;ity and Civility
  of Friends makes them, to per&#383;wade Men by &#383;pecious allegations,
  to gratifie their de&#383;ires; I &#383;hould have been made to believe
  by per&#383;ons very well qualify'd to judge of matters of this nature,
  that the following Experiments will not need the addition of accurate
  Method and &#383;peculative Notions to procure Acceptance for the
  Treati&#383;e that contains them: For it hath been repre&#383;ented, That
  in mo&#383;t of them, as the Novelty will make them &#383;urprizing, and
  the Quickne&#383;s of performance, keep them from being tedious; &#383;o
  the &#383;en&#383;ible changes, that are effected by them, are &#383;o
  manifest, &#383;o great, and &#383;o &#383;udden, that &#383;carce any
  will be di&#383;plea&#383;ed to &#383;ee them, and tho&#383;e that are
  any thing Curious will &#383;carce be able to &#383;ee them, without
  finding them&#383;elves excited, to make Reflexions upon Them. But though
  with me, who love to mea&#383;ure Phy&#383;ical things by their</i>
  u&#383;e, <i>not their</i> &#383;trangene&#383;s, <i>or</i>
  prettine&#383;s, <i>the partiality of others prevails not to make me over
  value the&#383;e, or look upon them in them&#383;elves as other than
  Trifles: Yet I confe&#383;s, that ever &#383;ince I did divers years ago
  &#383;hew &#383;ome of them to a Learned Company of</i> Virtuo&#383;i:
  <i>&#383;o many per&#383;ons of differing Conditions, and ev'n Sexes,
  have been Curious to &#383;ee them, and pleas'd not to Di&#383;like them,
  that I cannot De&#383;pair, but that by complying with tho&#383;e that
  urge the Publication of them, I may both gratifie and excite the Curious,
  and lay perhaps a Foundation whereon either others or my &#383;elf may in
  time &#383;uper&#383;truct a &#383;ub&#383;tantial theory of Colours. And
  if</i> Ari&#383;totle, <i>after his Ma&#383;ter</i> Plato, <i>have
  rightly ob&#383;erv'd Admiration to be the</i> Parent of Philo&#383;ophy,
  <i>the wonder, &#383;ome of the&#383;e Trifles have been wont to produce
  in all &#383;orts of Beholders, and the acce&#383;s they have
  &#383;ometimes gain'd ev'n to the Clo&#383;ets of Ladies, &#383;eem to
  promi&#383;e, that &#383;ince the &#383;ubject is &#383;o plea&#383;ing,
  that the Speculation appears as Delightful! as Difficult, &#383;uch
  ea&#383;ie and recreative Experiments, which require but little time, or
  charge, or trouble in the making, and when made are &#383;en&#383;ible
  and &#383;urprizing enough, may contribute more than others, (far more
  important but as much more difficult) to recommend tho&#383;e parts of
  Learning (Chymistry and Corpu&#383;cular Philo&#383;ophy) by which they
  have been produc'd, and to which they give Te&#383;timony ev'n to
  &#383;uch kind of per&#383;ons, as value a pretty Trick more than a true
  Notion, and would &#383;carce admit Philo&#383;ophy, if it approach'd
  them in another Dre&#383;s: without the &#383;trangene&#383;s or
  endearments of plea&#383;antne&#383;s to recommend it. I know that I do
  but ill con&#383;ult my own Advantage in the con&#383;enting to the
  Publication of the following Treati&#383;e: For tho&#383;e things, which,
  whil&#383;t men knew not how they were perform'd, appear'd &#383;o
  &#383;trange, will, when the way of making them, and the Grounds on which
  I devis'd them, &#383;hall be Publick, quickly lo&#383;e all that their
  being</i> Rarityes, <i>and their</i> being thought My&#383;teries,
  <i>contributed to recommend them. But 'tis fitter for Mountebancks than
  Naturalis to de&#383;ire to have their di&#383;coverys rather admir'd
  than under&#383;tood, and for my part I had much rather de&#383;erve the
  thanks of the Ingenious, than enjoy the Applau&#383;e of the Ignorant.
  And if I can &#383;o farr contribute to the di&#383;covery of the nature
  of Colours, as to help the Curious to it, I &#383;hall have reach'd my
  End, and &#383;av'd my &#383;elf &#383;ome Labour which el&#383;e I may
  chance be tempted to undergo in pro&#383;ecuting that &#383;ubect, and
  Adding to this Treati&#383;e, which I therefore call a</i> History,
  <i>becau&#383;e it chiefly contains matters of fact, and which
  Hi&#383;tory the Title declares me to look upon but as</i> Begun:
  <i>Becau&#383;e though that above a hundred, not to &#383;ay a hundred
  and fifty Experiments, (&#383;ome loo&#383;e, and others interwoven
  among&#383;t the di&#383;cour&#383;es them&#383;elves) may &#383;uffice
  to give a</i> Beginning <i>to a Hi&#383;tory not hitherto, that I know,
  begun, by any; yet the &#383;ubject is &#383;o fruitfull, and &#383;o
  worthy, that tho&#383;e that are Curious of the&#383;e Matters will be
  farr more wanting to them&#383;elves than I can &#383;u&#383;pect, if
  what I now publi&#383;h prove any more than a</i> Beginning. <i>For, as I
  hope my Endeavours may afford them &#383;ome a&#383;&#383;istance towards
  this work, &#383;o tho&#383;e Endeavours are much too Vnfini&#383;h'd to
  give them any di&#383;couragement, as if there were little left for
  others to do towards the Hi&#383;tory of Colours.</i></p>

  <p><i>For (fir&#383;t) I have been willing to leave unmention'd the</i>
  mo&#383;t part <i>of tho&#383;e Phænomena of Colours, that Nature
  pre&#383;ents us of her own accord, (that is, without being guided or
  over-ruld by man) &#383;uch as the different Colours that &#383;everal
  &#383;orts of Fruites pa&#383;s through before they are perfectly ripe,
  and tho&#383;e that appear upon the fading of flowers and leaves, and the
  putrifaction (and its &#383;everal degrees) of fruits, &amp;c. together
  with a thou&#383;and other obvious Instances of the changes of colours.
  Nor have I</i> much <i>medled with tho&#383;e familiar Phænomena wherein
  man is not an Idle &#383;pectator; &#383;uch as the Greenne&#383;s
  produc'd by &#383;alt in Beef much powder'd, and the Redne&#383;s
  produc'd in the &#383;hells of Lob&#383;ters upon the boyling of
  tho&#383;e fi&#383;hes; For I was willing to leave the</i> gathering
  <i>of</i> Ob&#383;ervations <i>to tho&#383;e that have not the
  Opportunity to</i> make Experiments. <i>And for the &#383;ame Rea&#383;ons,
  among others, I did purpo&#383;ly omit the Lucriferous practi&#383;e of
  Trades-men about colours; as the ways of making Pigments, of Bleanching
  wax, of dying Scarlet, &amp;c. though to divers of them I be not a
  stranger, and of &#383;ome I have my&#383;elf made Tryall.</i></p>

  <p><i>Next; I did purpo&#383;ely pa&#383;s by divers Experiments of other
  Writers that I had made Tryall of (and that not without regi&#383;tring
  &#383;ome of their Events) unle&#383;s I could &#383;ome way or other
  improve them, becau&#383;e I wanted lea&#383;ure to in&#383;ert them, and
  had thoughts of pro&#383;ecuting the work once begun of laying together
  tho&#383;e I had examin'd by them&#383;elves in ca&#383;e of my not being
  prevented by others diligence. So that there remains not a little, among
  the things that are already publi&#383;hed, to imploy tho&#383;e that
  have a mind to exerci&#383;e them&#383;elves in repeating and examining
  them. And I will not undertake, that</i> none <i>of the things deliver'd,
  ev'n in this Treati&#383;e, though never &#383;o faithfully &#383;et
  down, may not prove to be thus farr of this Sort, as to afford the
  Curious &#383;omewhat to add about them. For I remember that I have
  &#383;omewhere in the Book it &#383;elf acknowledged, that having written
  it by &#383;natches, partly in the Counntrey, and partly at
  un&#383;ea&#383;onable times of the year, when the want of fit
  In&#383;truments, and of a competent variety of flowers, &#383;alts,
  Pigments, and other materials made me leave &#383;ome of the following
  Experiments, (e&#383;pecialy tho&#383;e about Emphatical Colours) far
  more unfini&#383;h'd than they &#383;hould have been, if it had been as
  ea&#383;ie for me to</i> &#383;upply <i>what was wanting to compleat
  them, as to</i> di&#383;cern<i>. Thirdly to avoyd di&#383;couraging the
  young Gentleman I call Pyrophilus, whom the le&#383;s Familiar, and more
  Laborious operations of Chymistry would probably have frighted, I
  purpo&#383;ely declin'd in what I writ to him, the &#383;etting down any
  Number of &#383;uch Chymicall Experiments, as, by being very elaborate or
  tedious, would either require much skill, or exerci&#383;e his patience.
  And yet that this &#383;ort of Experiments is exceedingly Numerous, and
  might more than a little inrich the Hi&#383;tory of Colours, tho&#383;e
  that are vers'd in Chymical proce&#383;&#383;es, will, I pre&#383;ume,
  ea&#383;ily allow me.</i></p>

  <p><i>And (La&#383;tly) for as much as I have occa&#383;ion more than once
  in my &#383;everal Writings to treat either porpo&#383;ely or
  incidentally of matters relating to Colours; I did not, perhaps, conceive
  my &#383;elf oblig'd, to deliver in one Treati&#383;e</i> all <i>that I
  would &#383;ay concerning that &#383;ubject.</i></p>

  <p><i>But to conclude, by &#383;umming up what I would &#383;ay concerning
  what I</i> have <i>and what I</i> have not <i>done, in the following
  Papers; I &#383;hall not</i> (on the one &#383;ide) <i>deny, that
  con&#383;idering that I pretended not to write an accurate Treati&#383;e
  of Colours, but an Occa&#383;ional E&#383;&#383;ay to acquaint a private
  friend with what then occurrd to me of the things I had thought or try'd
  concerning them; I might pre&#383;ume I did enough for once, if I did
  clearly and faithfully &#383;et down, though not</i> all <i>the
  Experiments I could, yet at lea&#383;t &#383;uch a variety of them, that
  an attentive Reader that &#383;hall con&#383;ider the Grounds on which
  they have been made, and the hints that are purpo&#383;ely (though
  di&#383;per&#383;edly) couched in them, may ea&#383;ily</i> compound
  <i>them, and otherwi&#383;e</i> vary <i>them, &#383;o as very much to
  increa&#383;e their Number. And yet</i> (on the other &#383;ide) <i>I am
  &#383;o &#383;en&#383;ible both of how much I have, either out of
  nece&#383;&#383;ity or choice, left undone, and of the fruitfullne&#383;s
  of the &#383;ubject I have begun to handle; that though I had performed
  far more then 'tis like many Readers will judge I have, I &#383;hould yet
  be very free to let them apply to my Attempts that of</i> Seneca,
  <i>where having &#383;poken of the Study of Natures My&#383;teries, and
  Particularly of the Cau&#383;e of Earth-Quakes, he &#383;ubjoins.<a

  <p><i>Friendly Reader,</i></p>

  <p><img width="80" height="80" align="left" src="images/012b.png" alt="Illuminated H in Here" />Ere is pre&#383;ented to thy view one of the
  Ab&#383;tru&#383;e&#383;t as well as the Gentile&#383;t Subjects of
  Natural Philo&#383;ophy, the <i>Experimentall Hi&#383;tory of
  Colours</i>; which though the Noble Author be plea&#383;ed to think but
  <i>Begun</i>, yet I mu&#383;t take leave to &#383;ay, that I think it
  &#383;o well begun, that the work is more than half di&#383;patcht.
  Concerning which I cannot but give this adverti&#383;ement to the Reader,
  that I have heard the Author expre&#383;s him&#383;elf, that it would not
  &#383;urpri&#383;e him, if it &#383;hould happen to be objected, that
  &#383;ome of the&#383;e Experiments have been already publi&#383;hed,
  partly by Chymi&#383;ts, and partly by two or three very fre&#383;h
  Writers upon other Subjects. And though the number of the&#383;e
  Experiments be but very &#383;mall, and though they be none of the
  con&#383;iderable&#383;t, yet it may on this occa&#383;ion be further
  repre&#383;ented, that it is ea&#383;ie for our Author to name
  &#383;everal men, (of who&#383;e number I can truly name my &#383;elf)
  who remember either their having &#383;een him make, or their having
  read, his Accounts of the Experiments delivered in the following Tract
  &#383;everal years &#383;ince, and long before the publication of the
  Books, wherein they are mentioned. Nay in divers pa&#383;&#383;ages
  (where he could do it without any great inconvenience) he hath
  &#383;truck out Experiments, which he had tryed many years ago,
  becau&#383;e he &#383;ince found them divulged by per&#383;ons from whom
  he had not the lea&#383;t hint of them; which yet is not touched, with
  de&#383;ign to reflect upon any Ingenious Man, as if he were a Plagiary:
  For, though our Generous Author were not re&#383;erved enough in
  &#383;howing his Experiments to tho&#383;e that expre&#383;&#383;ed a
  Curio&#383;ity to &#383;ee them (among&#383;t whom a very Learned Man
  hath been plea&#383;ed publickly to acknowledge it &#383;everal years
  ago<a name="NtA_2"></a><a href="#Nt_2"><sup>2</sup></a>; yet the
  &#383;ame thing may be well enough lighted on by per&#383;ons that know
  nothing of one another. And e&#383;pecially Chymical Laboratories may
  many times afford the &#383;ame <i>Phænomenon</i> about Colours to
  &#383;everal per&#383;ons at the &#383;ame or differing times. And as for
  the few <i>Phænomena</i> mentioned in the &#383;ame Chymical writers, as
  well as in the following Treati&#383;e, our Author hath given an account,
  why he did not decline rejecting them, in the Anotations upon the
  47<sup>th</sup> Experiment of the third part. Not here to mention, what
  he el&#383;ewhere &#383;aith, to &#383;hew what u&#383;e may be
  Ju&#383;tifiably made of Experiments not of his own devi&#383;ing by a
  writer of Natural Hi&#383;tory, if, what he employes of others mens, be
  well examined or verified by him&#383;elf.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, this Treati&#383;e is &#383;uch, that there needs no
  other invitation to peru&#383;e it, but that tis compo&#383;ed by one of
  the Deepe&#383;t &amp; Mo&#383;t indefatigable &#383;earchers of Nature,
  which, I think the World, as far as I know it, affords. For mine own
  part, I feel a Secret Joy within me, to &#383;ee &#383;uch beginings upon
  &#383;uch <i>Themes</i>, it being demon&#383;tratively true, <i>Mota
  facilius moveri</i>, which cau&#383;eth me to entertain &#383;trong
  hopes, that this Illu&#383;trious <i>Virtuo&#383;o</i> and
  Re&#383;tle&#383;s Inquirer into Nature's Secrets will not &#383;top
  here, but go on and pro&#383;per in the Di&#383;qui&#383;ition or the
  other principal Colours, <i>Green, Red</i>, and <i>Yellow</i>. The
  Rea&#383;oning faculty &#383;et once afloat, will be carried on, and that
  with ea&#383;e, e&#383;pecially, when the productions thereof meet, as
  they do here, with &#383;o greedy an Entertainment at home and abroad. I
  am confident, that the <b>ROYAL SOCIETY</b>, lately con&#383;tituted by
  his <b>MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY</b> <i>for improving Natural knowledge</i>,
  will Judge it their intere&#383;t to exhort our Author to the
  pro&#383;ecution of this Argument, con&#383;idering, how much it is their
  de&#383;ign and bu&#383;ine&#383;s to accumulate a good &#383;tock of
  &#383;uch accurate Ob&#383;ervations and Experiments, as may afford them
  and their Offpring genuine Matter to rai&#383;e a Ma&#383;culine
  Philo&#383;ophy upon, whereby the Mind of Man may be enobled with the
  Knowledge of &#383;olid Truths, and the Life of Man benefited with ampler
  accommodations, than it hath been hitherto.</p>

  <p>Our Great Author, one of the Pillars of that Illu&#383;trious
  Corporation, is con&#383;tantly furni&#383;hing large <i>Symbola</i>'s to
  this work, and is now falln, as you &#383;ee, upon &#383;o
  comprehen&#383;ive and important a theme, as will, if in&#383;i&#383;ted
  on and compleated, prove one of the con&#383;iderable&#383;t peeces of
  that &#383;tructure. To which, if he &#383;hall plea&#383;e to add his
  Treati&#383;e of <i>Heat</i> and <i>Flame</i>, as he is ready to
  publi&#383;h his Experimental Accounts of <i>Cold</i>, I e&#383;teem, the
  World will be obliged to Him for having &#383;hewed them both the
  <i>Right</i> and <i>Left Hand</i> of Nature, and the Operations
  thereof.</p>

  <p>The con&#383;idering Reader will by this very Treati&#383;e &#383;ee
  abundant cau&#383;e to &#383;ollicit the Author for more; &#383;ure I am,
  that of whatever of the Productions of his Ingeny comes into <i>Forein
  parts</i> (where I am happy in the acquaintance of many intelligent
  friends) is highly valued; And to my knowledge, there are tho&#383;e
  among the French, that have lately begun to learn Engli&#383;h, on
  purpo&#383;e to enable them&#383;elves to read his Books, being impatient
  of their Traduction into Latin. If I dur&#383;t &#383;ay all, I know of
  the Elogies received by me from abroad concerning Him, I &#383;hould
  perhaps make this Preamble too prolix, and certainly offend the
  mode&#383;ty of our Author.</p>

  <p>Wherefore I &#383;hall leave this, and conclude with de&#383;iring the
  Reader, that if he meet with other faults be&#383;ides tho&#383;e, that
  the Errata take notice of (as I believe he may) he will plea&#383;e to
  con&#383;ider both the weakne&#383;s of the Authors eyes, for not
  reviewing, and the manifold Avocations of the Publi&#383;her for not
  doing his part; who taketh his leave with inviting tho&#383;e, that have
  al&#383;o con&#383;idered this Nice &#383;ubject experimentally, to
  follow the Example of our Noble Author, and impart &#383;uch and the like
  performances to the now very inqui&#383;itive world. <i>Farewell.</i></p>

  <p>Chap. 2. <i>Some general Con&#383;iderations are premis'd, fir&#383;t

  <i>and the Importance of it in others</i> (<a href="#Page_5">5</a>.)

  <p>Chap. 3. <i>That the Colour of Bodies depends chiefly on the
  di&#383;po&#383;ition of the Superficial parts, and partly upon the
  Variety of the Texture of the Object</i> (<a href="#Page_21">21</a>.)
  <i>The former of the&#383;e are confirm'd by &#383;everal

  &#383;ame kind of Porou&#383;ne&#383;s may be al&#383;o in the other

  Bulks, and clo&#383;ene&#383;s of Po&#383;ition</i> (<a

  Generation of Colour in&#383;tanc'd in the Whitene&#383;s of Froth, and
  in the mixtures of Dry colour'd Powders</i> (<a href="#Page_30">30</a>.)
  <i>A further explication of the Variety that may be in the Superficial

  <i>An Apology for that gro&#383;s Compari&#383;on</i> (<a

  making a Fi&#383;&#383;ure or Separation either in the Contiguous or

  <i>Fourthly, by a Union or Conjunction of the formerly &#383;eparated

  Superficial parts of another Body, whereby both their Bigne&#383;s and

  furni&#383;hing a per&#383;on, who, I hope, will both improve my

  Experiments and Ob&#383;ervations as may both invite you to enquire
  &#383;eriou&#383;ly into the Nature of Colours, and a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t
  you in the Inve&#383;tigation of it. This being the principal &#383;cope

  you an accurate and particular Theory of Colours; for that were to

  farr as in mee lay, to make that &#383;tudy needle&#383;s, to which I
  would engage you.</p>

  <p>2 Wherefore my pre&#383;ent work &#383;hall be but to divert and

  <i>delight</i>: And le&#383;t you &#383;hould expect any thing of
  Elaborate or Methodical in what you will meet with here, I mu&#383;t
  confe&#383;s to you before-hand, that the &#383;ea&#383;ons I was wont to
  chu&#383;e to devi&#383;e and try Experiments about Colours, were
  tho&#383;e daies, wherein having taken Phy&#383;ick, and finding my
  &#383;elf as unfit to &#383;peculate, as unwilling to be altogether idle,
  I cho&#383;e this diver&#383;ion, as a kind of Mean betwixt the one and
  the other. And I have the le&#383;s &#383;crupled to &#383;et down the
  following Experiments, as &#383;ome of them came to my mind, and as the
  Notes wherein I had &#383;et down the re&#383;t, occurr'd to my hands,
  that by declining a Methodical way of delivering them, I might leave you

  to <i>premi&#383;e</i> a few con&#383;iderations, that now offer
  them&#383;elves to my thoughts, which relate in a more general way,
  either to the Nature of Colours, or to the &#383;tudy of it. And I
  &#383;hall <i>in&#383;ert</i> an <i>E&#383;&#383;ay</i>, as well
  Speculative as Hi&#383;torical, of the Nature of Whitene&#383;s and
  Blackne&#383;s, that you may have a <i>Specimen</i> of the Hi&#383;tory
  of Colours, I have &#383;ometimes had thoughts of; and if you

  &#383;ome of the <i>Virtuo&#383;i</i>, your friends, may be thereby
  invited to go thorow with <i>Red, Blew, Yellow</i>, and the re&#383;t of
  the particular Colours, as I have done with <i>White</i> and
  <i>Black</i>, but with farr more &#383;agacity and &#383;ucce&#383;s. And
  if I can invite Ingenious men to undertake &#383;uch Tasks, I doubt not
  but the Curious will quickly obtain a better Account of Colours, than as
  yet we have, &#383;ince in our Method the Theorical part of the Enquiry
  being attended, and as it were interwoven with the Hi&#383;torical,
  whatever becomes of the di&#383;putable Conjectures, the Philo&#383;ophy
  of Colours will be promoted by the indi&#383;putable Experiments.</p>

<h3>CHAP. II.</h3>

  <p>1 To come then in the fir&#383;t place to our more general
  Con&#383;iderations, I &#383;hall begin with &#383;aying &#383;omething
  as to the Importance of examining the Colours of Bodies. For there are
  &#383;ome, e&#383;pecially <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i>, who think, that a
  con&#383;iderable diver&#383;ity of Colours does con&#383;tantly argue an
  equal diver&#383;ity of Nature, in the Bodies wherein it is
  con&#383;picuous; but I confe&#383;s I am not altogether of their mind;
  for not to mention changeable Taffaties, the blew and golden necks of
  Pidgeons, and divers Water-fowl, Rainbows Natural and Artificial, and
  other Bodies, who&#383;e Colours the Philo&#383;ophers have been
  plea&#383;ed to call not Real, but Apparent and Phanta&#383;tical; not to
  in&#383;i&#383;t on the&#383;e, I &#383;ay, (for fear of needle&#383;ly
  engaging in a Controver&#383;ie) we &#383;ee in Parrots, Goldfinches, and
  divers other Birds, not only that the contiguous feathers which are
  probably as near in properties as place, are &#383;ome of them Red, and
  others White, &#383;ome of them Blew, &amp; others Yellow, <i>&amp;c.</i>
  but that in the &#383;everal parts of the &#383;elf-&#383;ame feather
  there may often be &#383;een the greate&#383;t di&#383;parity of Colours;
  and &#383;o in the leaves of Tulips, July-flowers, and &#383;ome other
  Vegetables <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5"></a>[pg
  5]</span> the &#383;everal leaves, and even the &#383;everal parts of the
  &#383;ame leaf, although no difference have been ob&#383;erved in their
  other properties, are frequently found painted with very different
  Colours. And &#383;uch a variety we have much more admired in that lovely
  plant which is commonly, and not unju&#383;tly call'd the <i>Marvayl of
  Peru</i>; for of divers &#383;cores of fine Flowers, which in its
  &#383;ea&#383;on that gaudy Plant does almo&#383;t daily produce, I have
  &#383;carce taken notice of any two that were dyed perfectly alike. But
  though <i>Pyro</i>: &#383;uch things as the&#383;e, among others, keep
  mee from daring to affirm, that the Diver&#383;ity and change of Colours
  does <i>alwaies</i> argue any great difference or alteration, betwixt, or
  in, the Bodies, wherein it is to be di&#383;cerned, yet that
  <i>oftentimes</i> the Alteration of Colours does &#383;ignifie
  con&#383;iderable Alterations in the di&#383;po&#383;ition of parts of
  Bodies, may appear in the Extraction of Tinctures, and divers other
  Chymical Operations, wherein the change of Colours is the chief, and
  &#383;ometimes the only thing, by which the Arti&#383;t regulates his
  proceeding, and is taught to know when 'tis &#383;ea&#383;onable for him
  to leave off. In&#383;tances of this &#383;ort are more obvious in divers
  &#383;orts of fruits, as Cherries, Plums, &amp;c. wherein, according as
  the Vegetable &#383;ap is &#383;weetned, or otherwi&#383;e <!-- Page 6
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6"></a>[pg 6]</span> ripened, by
  pa&#383;&#383;ing from one degree to another of Maturation, the external
  part of the fruit pa&#383;&#383;es likewi&#383;e from one to another
  Colour. But one of the noble&#383;t In&#383;tances I have met with of
  this kind, is not &#383;o obvious; and that is the way of tempering Steel
  to make Gravers, Drills, Springs, and other Mechanical In&#383;truments,
  which we have divers times both made Artificers practi&#383;e in our
  pre&#383;ence, and tryed our &#383;elves, after the following manner,
  Fir&#383;t, the &#383;lender Steel to be tempered is to be hardened by
  heating as much of it as is requi&#383;ite among glowing Coals, till it
  be glowing hot, but it mu&#383;t not be quenched a&#383;&#383;oon as it
  is taken from the fire (for that would make it too brittle, and
  &#383;poil it) but mu&#383;t be held over a ba&#383;on of water, till it
  de&#383;cend from a White heat to a Red one, which a&#383;&#383;oon as
  ever you perceive, you mu&#383;t immediately quench as much as you
  de&#383;ire to harden in the cold water. The Steel thus hardened, will,
  if it be good, look &#383;omewhat White and mu&#383;t be made bright at
  the end, that its change of Colours may be there con&#383;picuous; and
  then holding it &#383;o in the flame of a Candle, that the bright end may
  be, for about half an inch, or more, out of the flame, that the
  &#383;moak do not &#383;tain or &#383;ully the brightne&#383;s of it, you
  &#383;hall after a <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_7"></a>[pg 7]</span> while &#383;ee that clean end, which is
  almo&#383;t contiguous to the flame, pa&#383;s very nimbly from one
  Colour to another, as from a brighter Yellow, to a deeper and
  reddi&#383;h Yellow, which Artificers call a <i>&#383;anguine</i>, and
  from that to a fainter fir&#383;t, and then a a deeper Blew. And to bring
  home this Experiment to our pre&#383;ent purpo&#383;e, it is found by
  daily Experience, that each of the&#383;e &#383;ucceeding Colours argue
  &#383;uch a change made in the texture of the Steel, that if it be taken
  from the flame, and immediately quenched in the tallow (whereby it is
  &#383;etled in whatever temper it had before) when it is Yellow, it is of
  &#383;uch a hardne&#383;s as makes it fit for Gravers Drills, and
  &#383;uch like tools; but if it be kept a few minutes longer in the flame
  till it grow Blew, it becomes much &#383;ofter, and unfit to make Gravers
  for Metalls, but fit to make Springs for Watches, and &#383;uch like
  In&#383;truments, which are therefore commonly of that Colour; and if the
  Steel be kept in the flame, after that this deep Blew hath
  di&#383;clo&#383;ed it &#383;elf, it will grow &#383;o &#383;oft, as to
  need to be new hardened again, before it can be brought to a temper, fit
  for Drills or Penknives. And I confe&#383;s <i>Pyro.</i> I have taken
  much plea&#383;ure to &#383;ee the Colours run along from the parts of
  the Steel contiguous to the flame, to the end of the In&#383;trument,
  <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8"></a>[pg 8]</span>
  and &#383;ucceed one another &#383;o fa&#383;t, that if a man be not
  vigilant, to thru&#383;t the Steel into the tallow at the very nick of
  time, at which it has attain'd its due Colour, he &#383;hall mi&#383;s of
  giving his tool the right temper. But becau&#383;e the flame of a Candle
  is offen&#383;ive to my weak eyes, and becau&#383;e it is apt to either
  black or &#383;ully the contiguous part of the Steel which is held in it,
  and thereby hinder the change of Colours from being &#383;o long and
  clearly di&#383;cern'd, I have &#383;ometimes made this Experiment by
  laying the Steel to be tempered upon a heated bar of Iron, which we finde
  al&#383;o to be employ'd by &#383;ome Artificers in the tempering of
  &#383;uch great In&#383;truments, as are too big to be &#383;oon heated
  &#383;ufficiently by the flame of a Candle. And you may ea&#383;ily
  &#383;atisfie your &#383;elf <i>Pyro</i>: of the differing hardne&#383;s
  and toughne&#383;s, which is a&#383;cribed to Steel temper'd at different
  Colours, if you break but &#383;ome &#383;lender wires of Steel &#383;o
  temper'd, and ob&#383;erve how they differ in brittlene&#383;s, and if
  with a file you al&#383;o make tryal of their various degrees of
  hardne&#383;s.</p>

  <p>2 But <i>Pyrophilus</i>, I mu&#383;t not at pre&#383;ent any further
  pro&#383;ecute the Con&#383;ideration of the importance of Experiments
  about Colours, not only becau&#383;e you will in the following papers
  finde &#383;ome in&#383;tances, that would here <!-- Page 9 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9"></a>[pg 9]</span> be pre&#383;ented you
  out of their due place, of the u&#383;e that may be made of &#383;uch
  Experiments, in di&#383;covering in divers bodies, what kind the
  &#383;alt is, that is predominant in them; but al&#383;o becau&#383;e a
  &#383;peculative Naturali&#383;t might ju&#383;tly enough allege, that as
  Light is &#383;o plea&#383;ing an object, as to be well worth our looking
  on, though it di&#383;cover'd to us nothing but its &#383;elf; &#383;o
  modifi'd Light called Colour, were worth our contemplation, though by
  under&#383;tanding its Nature we &#383;hould be taught nothing el&#383;e.
  And however, I need not make either you or my &#383;elf excu&#383;es for
  entertaining you on the &#383;ubject I am now about to treat of,
  &#383;ince the plea&#383;ure <i>Pyro</i>: takes in mixing and laying on
  of Colours, will I pre&#383;ume keep him, and will (I am &#383;ure) keep
  mee from thinking it trouble&#383;ome to &#383;et down, e&#383;pecially
  after the tedious proce&#383;&#383;es (about other matters) wherewith I
  fear I may have tyr'd him, &#383;ome ea&#383;ie, and not unplea&#383;ant
  Experiments relating to that &#383;ubject.</p>

  <p>3 But, before we de&#383;cend to the more particular
  con&#383;iderations, we are to pre&#383;ent you concerning Colours, I
  pre&#383;ume it will be &#383;ea&#383;onable to propo&#383;e at the very
  entrance a Di&#383;tinction; the ignorance or neglect of which,
  &#383;eems to mee to have frequently enough occa&#383;ioned either
  mi&#383;takes or confu&#383;ion <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_10"></a>[pg 10]</span> in the Writings of divers Modern
  Philo&#383;ophers; for Colour may be con&#383;idered, either as it is a
  quality re&#383;iding in the body that is &#383;aid to be coloured, or to
  modifie the light after &#383;uch or &#383;uch a manner; or el&#383;e as
  the Light it &#383;elf, which &#383;o modifi'd, &#383;trikes upon the
  organ of &#383;ight, and &#383;o cau&#383;es that Sen&#383;ation which we
  call Colour; and that this latter may be look'd upon as the more proper,
  though not the u&#383;ual acception of the word Colour, will be made
  probable by divers pa&#383;&#383;ages in the in&#383;uing part of our
  di&#383;cour&#383;e; and indeed it is the Light it &#383;elf, which after
  a certain manner, either mingled with &#383;hades, or &#383;ome other
  waies troubled, &#383;trikes our eyes, that does more immediately produce
  that motion in the organ, upon who&#383;e account men &#383;ay they
  &#383;ee &#383;uch or &#383;uch a Colour in the object; yet, becau&#383;e
  there is in the body that is &#383;aid to be coloured, a certain
  di&#383;po&#383;ition of the &#383;uperficial particles, whereby it
  &#383;ends the Light reflected, or refracted, to our eyes thus and thus
  alter'd, and not otherwi&#383;e, it may al&#383;o in &#383;ome
  &#383;en&#383;e be &#383;aid, that Colour depends upon the vi&#383;ible
  body; and therefore we &#383;hall not be again&#383;t that way of
  &#383;peaking of Colours that is mo&#383;t u&#383;ed among the Modern
  Naturali&#383;ts, provided we be allowed to have recour&#383;e when
  occa&#383;ion &#383;hall <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_11"></a>[pg 11]</span> require to the premis'd
  di&#383;tinction, and to take the more immediate cau&#383;e of Colour to
  be the modifi'd Light it &#383;elf, as it affects the Sen&#383;ory;
  though the di&#383;po&#383;ition al&#383;o of the colour'd body, as that
  modifies the Light, may be call'd by that name Metonimically (to borrow a
  School term) or Efficiently, that is in regard of its turning the Light,
  that rebounds from it, or pa&#383;&#383;es thorow it, into this or that
  particular Colour.</p>

  <p>4 I know not whether I may not on this occa&#383;ion add, that Colour
  is &#383;o far from being an Inherent quality of the object in the
  &#383;en&#383;e that is wont to be declar'd by the Schools, or even in
  the &#383;en&#383;e of &#383;ome Modern Atomi&#383;ts, that, if we
  con&#383;ider the matter more attentively, we &#383;hall &#383;ee
  cau&#383;e to &#383;u&#383;pect, if not to conclude, that though Light do
  more immediately affect the organ of &#383;ight, than do the bodies that
  &#383;end it thither, yet Light it &#383;elf produces the
  &#383;en&#383;ation of a Colour, but as it produces &#383;uch a
  determinate kind of local motion in &#383;ome part of the brain; which,
  though it happen mo&#383;t commonly from the motion whereinto the
  &#383;lender &#383;trings of the <i>Retina</i> are put, by the
  appul&#383;e of Light, yet if the like motion happen to be produc'd by
  any other cau&#383;e, wherein the Light concurrs not at <!-- Page 12
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"></a>[pg 12]</span> all, a man
  &#383;hall think he &#383;ees the &#383;ame Colour. For proof of this, I
  might put you in mind, that 'tis u&#383;ual for dreaming men to think
  they &#383;ee the Images that appear to them in their &#383;leep, adorn'd
  &#383;ome with this, and &#383;ome with that lively Colour, whil&#383;t
  yet, both the curtains of their bed, and tho&#383;e of their eyes are
  clo&#383;e drawn. And I might add the confidence with which
  di&#383;tracted per&#383;ons do oftentimes, when they are awake, think,
  they &#383;ee black fiends in places, where there is no black object in
  &#383;ight without them. But I will rather ob&#383;erve, that not only
  when a man receives a great &#383;troak upon his eye, or a very great one
  upon &#383;ome other part of his head, he is wont to &#383;ee, as it
  were, fla&#383;hes of lightning, and little vivid, but vani&#383;hing
  flames, though perhaps his eyes be &#383;hut: But the like apparitions
  may happen, when the motion proceeds not from &#383;omething without, but
  from &#383;omething within the body, provided the unwonted fumes that
  wander up and down in the head, or the propagated concu&#383;&#383;ion of
  any internal part in the body, do cau&#383;e about the inward extremities
  of the Optick Nerve, &#383;uch a motion as is wont to be there produc'd,
  when the &#383;troak of the Light upon the <i>Retina</i> makes us
  conclude, that we &#383;ee either Light, or &#383;uch and &#383;uch a
  <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13"></a>[pg
  13]</span> Colour: This the mo&#383;t ingenious <i>Des Cartes</i> hath
  very well ob&#383;erv'd, but becau&#383;e he &#383;eems not to have
  exemplifi'd it by any unobvious or peculiar ob&#383;ervation, I
  &#383;hall indeavour to illu&#383;trate this doctrine by a few
  In&#383;tances.</p>

  <p>5 And fir&#383;t, I remember, that having, through Gods goodne&#383;s,
  been free for &#383;everal years, from trouble&#383;ome Coughs, being
  afterwards, by an accident, &#383;uddenly ca&#383;t into a violent one, I
  did often, when I was awaked in the night by my di&#383;tempers,
  ob&#383;erve, that upon coughing &#383;trongly, it would &#383;eem to
  mee, that I &#383;aw very vivid, but immediately di&#383;appearing
  flames, which I took particular notice of, becau&#383;e of the conjecture
  I am now mentioning.</p>

  <p>6 An excellent and very di&#383;creet per&#383;on, very near ally'd
  both to you and mee, was relating to mee, that &#383;ome time &#383;ince,
  whil&#383;t &#383;he was talking with &#383;ome other Ladies, upon a
  &#383;udden, all the objects, &#383;he looked upon, appeared to her dyed
  with unu&#383;ual Colours, &#383;ome of one kind, and &#383;ome of
  another, but all &#383;o bright and vivid, that &#383;he &#383;hould have
  been as much delighted, as &#383;urpriz'd with them, but that finding the
  apparition to continue, &#383;he fear'd it portended &#383;ome very great
  alteration as to her health: As indeed the day after &#383;he was
  a&#383;&#383;aulted <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_14"></a>[pg 14]</span> with &#383;uch violence by
  Hy&#383;terical and Hypocondrical Di&#383;tempers, as both made her rave
  for &#383;ome daies, and gave her, during that time, a Ba&#383;tard
  Pal&#383;ey.</p>

  <p>7 Being a while &#383;ince in a Town, where the Plague had made great
  havock, and inquiring of an ingenious man, that was &#383;o bold, as
  without much &#383;cruple to vi&#383;it tho&#383;e that were &#383;ick of
  it, about the odd &#383;ymptomes of a Di&#383;ea&#383;e that had
  &#383;wept away &#383;o many there; he told mee, among other things, that
  he was able to tell divers Patients, to whom he was called, before they
  took their beds, or had any evident &#383;ymptomes of the Plague, that
  they were indeed infected upon peculiar ob&#383;ervations, that being
  asked, they would tell him that the neighbouring objects, and
  particularly his cloths, appear'd to them beautifi'd with mo&#383;t
  glorious Colours, like tho&#383;e of the Rainbow, oftentimes
  &#383;ucceeding one another; and this he affirm'd to be one of the
  mo&#383;t u&#383;ual, as well as the mo&#383;t early &#383;ymptomes, by
  which this odd Pe&#383;tilence di&#383;clos'd it &#383;elf: And when I
  asked how long the Patients were wont to be thus affected, he
  an&#383;wered, that it was mo&#383;t commonly for about a day; and when I
  further inquired whether or no Vomits, which in that Pe&#383;tilence were
  u&#383;ually given, did not remove this &#383;ymptome <!-- Page 15
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15"></a>[pg 15]</span> (For
  &#383;ome u&#383;ed the taking of a Vomit, when they came a&#383;hore, to
  cure them&#383;elves of the ob&#383;tinate and trouble&#383;ome
  giddine&#383;s caus'd by the motion of the &#383;hip) reply'd, that
  generally, upon the evacuation made by the Vomit, that &#383;trange
  apparition of Colours cea&#383;ed, though the other &#383;ymptomes were
  not &#383;o &#383;oon abated, yet he added (to take notice of that upon
  the by, becau&#383;e the ob&#383;ervation may perchance do good) that an
  excellent Phy&#383;ician, in who&#383;e company he was wont to vi&#383;it
  the &#383;ick, did give to almo&#383;t all tho&#383;e to whom he was
  called, in the beginning before Nature was much weakened, a pretty odd
  Vomit con&#383;i&#383;ting of eight or ten dramms of Infu&#383;ion of
  <i>Crocus Metallorum</i>, and about half a dramm, or much more, of White
  Vitriol, with &#383;uch &#383;ucce&#383;s, that &#383;carce one of ten to
  whom it was &#383;ea&#383;onably admini&#383;tred, mi&#383;carried.</p>

  <p>8 But to return to the con&#383;ideration of Colours: As an apparition
  of them may be produced by motions from within, without the
  a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of an outward object, &#383;o I have
  ob&#383;erved, that 'tis &#383;ometimes po&#383;&#383;ible that the
  Colour that would otherwi&#383;e be produced by an outward object, may be
  chang'd by &#383;ome motion, or new texture already produced in the
  Sen&#383;ory, as long as that unu&#383;ual motion, or new
  di&#383;po&#383;ition <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_16"></a>[pg 16]</span> la&#383;ts; for I have divers times
  try'd, that after I have through a Tele&#383;cope look'd upon the Sun,
  though thorow a thick, red, or blew gla&#383;s, to make its &#383;plendor
  &#383;upportable to the eye, the impre&#383;&#383;ion upon the
  <i>Retina</i>, would be not only &#383;o vivid, but &#383;o permanent,
  that if afterwards I turned my eye towards a flame, it would appear to
  mee of a Colour very differing from its u&#383;ual one. And if I did
  divers times &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively &#383;hut and open the &#383;ame
  eye, I &#383;hould &#383;ee the adventitious Colour, (if I may &#383;o
  call it) changed or impair'd by degrees, till at length (for this
  unu&#383;ual motion of the eye would not pre&#383;ently cea&#383;e) the
  flame would appear to mee, of the &#383;ame hew that it did to other
  beholders; a not unlike effect I found by looking upon the Moon, when
  &#383;he was near full, thorow an excellent Tele&#383;cope, without
  colour'd Gla&#383;s to &#383;creen my eye with; But that which I
  de&#383;ire may be taken notice of, becau&#383;e we may el&#383;ewhere
  have occa&#383;ion to reflect upon it, and becau&#383;e it &#383;eems not
  agreeable to what Anatomi&#383;ts and Optical Writers deliver, touching
  the relation of the two eyes to each other, is this circum&#383;tance,
  that though my Right eye, with which I looked thorow the Tele&#383;cope,
  were thus affected by the over-&#383;trong impre&#383;&#383;ion of the
  light, yet when the flame <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_17"></a>[pg 17]</span> of a Candle, or &#383;ome other bright
  object appear'd to me of a very unu&#383;ual Colour, whil&#383;t look'd
  upon with the Di&#383;compos'd Eye, or (though not &#383;o notably) with
  both eyes at once; yet if I &#383;hut that Eye, and looked upon the
  &#383;ame object with the other, it would appear with no other than its
  u&#383;ual Colour, though if I again opened, and made u&#383;e of the
  Dazled eye, the vivid adventitious Colour would again appear. And on this
  occa&#383;ion I mu&#383;t not pretermit an Ob&#383;ervation which may
  per&#383;wade us, that an over-vehement &#383;troak upon the
  Sen&#383;ory, e&#383;pecially if it be naturally of a weak
  con&#383;titution, may make a more la&#383;ting impre&#383;&#383;ion than
  one would imagine, which impre&#383;&#383;ion may in &#383;ome
  ca&#383;es, as it were, mingle with, and vitiate the action of vivid
  objects for a long time after.</p>

  <p>For I know a Lady of unque&#383;tionable Veracity, who having lately,
  by a de&#383;perate fall, receiv'd &#383;everal hurts, and particularly a
  con&#383;iderable one upon a part of her face near her Eye, had her
  &#383;ight &#383;o troubl'd and di&#383;order'd, that, as &#383;he hath
  more than once related to me, not only when the next morning one of her
  &#383;ervants came to her bed &#383;ide, to ask how &#383;he did, his
  cloaths appear'd adorn'd with &#383;uch variety of dazling Colours, that
  &#383;he was fain pre&#383;ently to <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18"></a>[pg 18]</span> command him to
  withdraw, but the Images in her Hangings, did, for many daies after,
  appear to her, if the Room were not extraordinarily darken'd,
  embelli&#383;h'd with &#383;everal offen&#383;ively vivid Colours, which
  no body el&#383;e could &#383;ee in them; And when I enquir'd whether or
  no White Objects did not appear to her adorn'd with more luminous Colours
  than others, and whether &#383;he &#383;aw not &#383;ome which &#383;he
  could not now well de&#383;cribe to any, who&#383;e eyes had never been
  di&#383;temper'd, &#383;he an&#383;wer'd mee, that &#383;ometimes
  &#383;he thought &#383;he &#383;aw Colours &#383;o new and glorious, that
  they were of a peculiar kind, and &#383;uch as &#383;he could not
  de&#383;cribe by their likene&#383;s to any &#383;he had beheld either
  before or &#383;ince, and that White Objects did &#383;o much
  di&#383;order her &#383;ight, that if &#383;everal daies after her fall,
  &#383;he look'd upon the in&#383;ide of a Book, &#383;he fanci'd &#383;he
  &#383;aw there Colours like tho&#383;e of the Rain-bow, and even when
  &#383;he thought her &#383;elf pretty well recover'd, and made bold to
  leave her Chamber, the coming into a place where the Walls and Ceeling
  were whited over, made tho&#383;e Objects appear to her cloath'd with
  &#383;uch glorious and dazling Colours, as much offended her &#383;ight,
  and made her repent her venturou&#383;ne&#383;s, and &#383;he added, that
  this Di&#383;temper of her Eyes la&#383;ted no le&#383;s <!-- Page 19
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"></a>[pg 19]</span> than five
  or &#383;ix weeks, though, &#383;ince that, &#383;he hath been able to
  read and write much without finding the lea&#383;t Inconvenience in doing
  &#383;o. I would gladly have known, whether if &#383;he had &#383;hut the
  Injur'd Eye, the <i>Phænomena</i> would have been the &#383;ame, when
  &#383;he employ'd only the other, but I heard not of this accident early
  enough to &#383;atisfie that Enquiry.</p>

  <p>9 Wherefore, I &#383;hall now add, that &#383;ome years before, a
  per&#383;on exceedingly eminent for his profound Skil in almo&#383;t all
  kinds of Philological Learning, coming to advi&#383;e with mee about a
  Di&#383;temper in his Eyes, told me, among other Circum&#383;tances of
  it, that, having upon a time looked too fixedly upon the Sun, thorow a
  Tele&#383;cope, without any coloured Gla&#383;s, to take off from the
  dazling &#383;plendour of the Object, the exce&#383;s of Light did
  &#383;o &#383;trongly affect his Eye, that ever &#383;ince, when he turns
  it towards a Window, or any White Object, he fancies, he &#383;eeth a
  Globe of Light, of about the bigne&#383;s the Sun then appeared of to
  him, to pa&#383;s before his Eyes: And having Inquir'd of him, how long
  he had been troubled with this Indi&#383;po&#383;ition, he reply'd, that
  it was already nine or ten years, &#383;ince the Accident, that
  occa&#383;ioned it, fir&#383;t befel him.</p>

<!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20"></a>[pg 20]</span>

  <p>I could here &#383;ubjoyn, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, &#383;ome memorable
  Relations that I have met with in the Account given us by the experienc'd
  <i>Epiphanius Ferdinandus</i>, of the Symptomes he ob&#383;erv'd to be
  incident to tho&#383;e that are bitten with the Tarantula, by which
  (Relations) I could probably &#383;hew, that without any change in the
  Object, a change in the In&#383;truments of Vi&#383;ion may for a great
  while make &#383;ome Colours appear Charming, and make others Provoking,
  and both to a high degree, though neither of them produc'd any &#383;uch
  Effects before. The&#383;e things, I &#383;ay, I could here &#383;ubjoyn
  in confirmation of what I have been &#383;aying, to &#383;hew, that the
  Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the Organ is of great Importance in the
  Dijudications we make of Colours, were it not that the&#383;e
  &#383;trange Stories belonging more properly to another
  Di&#383;cour&#383;e, I had rather, (contenting my &#383;elf to have given
  you an Intimation of them here) that you &#383;hould meet with them fully
  deliver'd there.</p>

<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>

  <p>But, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, I would not by all that I have hitherto
  di&#383;cours'd, be thought to have forgotten the Di&#383;tinction <!--
  Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21"></a>[pg 21]</span> (of
  Colour) that I mentioned to you about the beginning of the third Section
  of the former Chapter; and therefore, after all I have &#383;aid of
  Colour, as it is modifi'd Light, and immediately affects the
  Sen&#383;ory, I &#383;hall now re-mind you, that I did not deny, but that
  Colour might in &#383;ome &#383;en&#383;e be con&#383;ider'd as a Quality
  re&#383;iding in the body that is &#383;aid to be Colour'd, and indeed
  the greate&#383;t part of the following Experiments referr to Colour
  principally under that Notion, for there is in the bodyes we call
  Colour'd, and chiefly in their Superficial parts, a certain
  di&#383;po&#383;ition, whereby they do &#383;o trouble the Light that
  comes from them to our Eye, as that it there makes that di&#383;tinct
  Impre&#383;&#383;ion, upon who&#383;e Account we &#383;ay, that the Seen
  body is either White or Black, or Red or Yellow, or of any one
  determinate Colour. But becau&#383;e we &#383;hall (God permiting) by the
  Experiments that are to follow &#383;ome Pages hence, more fully and
  particularly &#383;hew, that the Changes, and con&#383;equently in divers
  places the Production and the appearance of Colours depends upon the
  continuing or alter'd Texture of the Object, we &#383;hall in this place
  intimate (and that too but as by the way) two or three things about this
  Matter.</p>

  <p>2. And fir&#383;t it is not without &#383;ome Rea&#383;on, <!-- Page
  22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22"></a>[pg 22]</span> that I
  a&#383;cribe Colour (in the &#383;en&#383;e formerly explan'd)
  <i>chiefly</i> to the Superficial parts of Bodies, for not to
  que&#383;tion how much Opacous Corpu&#383;cles may abound even in
  tho&#383;e Bodies we call Diaphanous, it &#383;eems plain that of Opacous
  bodies we do indeed &#383;ee little el&#383;e than the Superficies, for
  if we found the beams of Light that rebound from the Object to the Eye,
  to peirce deep into the Colour'd body, we &#383;hould not judge it
  Opacous, but either Tran&#383;lucid, or at lea&#383;t Semi-diaphanous,
  and though the Schools &#383;eem to teach us that Colour is a Penetrative
  Quality, that reaches to the Innermo&#383;t parts of the Object, as if a
  piece of Sealing-wax be broken into never &#383;o many pieces, the
  Internal fragments will be as Red as the External &#383;urface did
  appear, yet that is but a Particular Example that will not overthrow the
  Rea&#383;on lately offer'd, e&#383;pecially &#383;ince I can alleage
  other Examples of a contrary Import, and two or three Negative
  In&#383;tances are &#383;ufficient to overthrow the Generality of a
  Po&#383;itive Rule, e&#383;pecially if that be built but upon One or a
  Few Examples. Not (then) to mention Cherries, Plums, and I know not how
  many other Bodies, wherein the skin is of one Colour, and what it hides
  of another, I &#383;hall name a couple of In&#383;tances drawn from the
  Colours <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23"></a>[pg
  23]</span> of Durable bodies that are thought far more Homogeneous, and
  have not parts that are either Organical, or of a Nature approaching
  thereunto.</p>

  <p>3 To give you the fir&#383;t In&#383;tance, I &#383;hall need but to
  remind you of what I told you a little after the beginning of this
  E&#383;&#383;ay, touching the Blew and Red and Yellow, that may be
  produc'd upon a piece of temper'd Steel, for the&#383;e Colours though
  they be very Vivid, yet if you break the Steel they adorn, they will
  appear to be but Superficial; not only the innermo&#383;t parts of the
  Metall, but tho&#383;e that are within a hairs breadth of the
  Superficies, having not any of the&#383;e Colours, but retaining that of
  the Steel it &#383;elf. Be&#383;ides that, we may as well confirm this
  Ob&#383;ervation, as &#383;ome other particulars we el&#383;ewhere
  deliver concerning Colours, by the following Experiment which we
  purpo&#383;ely made.</p>

  <p>4 We took a good quantity of clean Lead, and melted it with a
  &#383;trong Fire, and then immediately pouring it out into a clean
  Ve&#383;&#383;el of a convenient &#383;hape and matter, (we us'd one of
  Iron, that the great and &#383;udden Heat might not injure it) and then
  carefully and nimbly taking off the Scum that floated on the top, we
  perceiv'd, as we expected, the &#383;mooth and <!-- Page 24 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24"></a>[pg 24]</span> glo&#383;&#383;ie
  Surface of the melted matter, to be adorn'd with a very glorious Colour,
  which being as Tran&#383;itory as Delightfull, did almo&#383;t
  immediately give place to another vivid Colour, and that was as quickly
  &#383;ucceeded by a third, and this as it were chas'd away by a fourth,
  and &#383;o the&#383;e wonderfully vivid Colours
  &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively appear'd and vani&#383;h'd, (yet the
  &#383;ame now and then appearing the &#383;econd time) till the Metall
  cea&#383;ing to be hot enough to afford any longer this plea&#383;ing
  Spectacle, the Colours that chanc'd to adorn the Surface, when the Lead
  thus began to cool, remain'd upon it; but were &#383;o Superficial, that
  how little &#383;oever we &#383;crap'd off the Surface of the Lead, we
  did in &#383;uch places &#383;crape off all the Colour, and di&#383;cover
  only that which is natural to the Metall it &#383;elf, which receiving
  its adventitious Colours, only when the heat was very Inten&#383;e, and
  in that part which was expos'd to the comparatively very cold Air, (which
  by other Experiments &#383;eems to abound with &#383;ubtil Saline parts,
  perhaps not uncapable of working upon Lead &#383;o di&#383;pos'd:)
  The&#383;e things I &#383;ay, together with my ob&#383;erving that
  whatever parts of the &#383;o &#383;trongly melted Lead were expos'd a
  while to the Air, turn'd into a kind of Scum or Litharge, <!-- Page 25
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25"></a>[pg 25]</span> how bright
  and clean &#383;oever they appear'd before, &#383;ugge&#383;ted to me
  &#383;ome Thoughts or Ravings, which I have not now time to acquaint You
  with. One that did not know me, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, would perchance think
  I endeavour'd to impo&#383;e upon You by relating this Experiment, which
  I have &#383;everal times try'd, but the Rea&#383;on why the
  <i>Phænomena</i> mention'd have not been taken notice of, may be, that
  unle&#383;s Lead be brought to a much higher degree of Fu&#383;ion or
  Fluidity than is u&#383;ual, or than is indeed requi&#383;ite to make it
  melt, the <i>Phænomena</i> I mention'd will &#383;carce at all
  di&#383;clo&#383;e them&#383;elves; And we have al&#383;o ob&#383;erv'd
  that this &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ive appearing and vani&#383;hing of vivid
  Colours, was wont to be impair'd or determin'd whil&#383;t the Metal
  expos'd to the Air remain'd yet hotter than one would readily
  &#383;u&#383;pect. And one thing I mu&#383;t further Note, of which I
  leave You to &#383;earch after the Rea&#383;on, namely, that the
  &#383;ame Colours did not always and regularly &#383;ucceed one another,
  as is u&#383;ually in Steel, but in the diver&#383;ify'd Order mention'd
  in this following Note, which I was &#383;carce able to write down, the
  &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ion of the Colours was &#383;o very quick, whether
  that proceeded from the differing degrees of Heat in the Lead expos'd to
  the cool Air, or from &#383;ome <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_26"></a>[pg 26]</span> other Rea&#383;on, I leave you to
  examine.</p>

  <p>5. The <i>Atomi&#383;ts</i> of Old, and &#383;ome Learned men of late,
  have attempted to explicate the variety of Colours in Opacous bodies from
  the various Figures of their Superficial parts; the attempt is Ingenious,
  and the Doctrine &#383;eems partly True, but I confe&#383;s I think there
  are divers other things that mu&#383;t be taken in as concurrent to
  produce tho&#383;e differing forms of A&#383;perity, whereon the Colours
  of Opacous bodies &#383;eem to depend. To declare this a little, we
  mu&#383;t a&#383;&#383;ume, that the Surfaces of all &#383;uch Bodies how
  Smooth or polite &#383;oever they may appear to our Dull Sight and Touch,
  are exactly &#383;mooth only in a popular, or at mo&#383;t in a
  Phy&#383;ical &#383;en&#383;e, but not in a &#383;trict and rigid
  &#383;en&#383;e.</p>

  <p>6. This, excellent <i>Micro&#383;copes</i> &#383;hew us in many
  Bodies, that &#383;eem Smooth to our naked Eyes; and this not only as to
  the little Hillocks or Protuberancies that &#383;well <!-- Page 27
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27"></a>[pg 27]</span> above that
  which may be conceiv'd to be the Plain or Level of the con&#383;ider'd
  Surface, for it is obvious enough to tho&#383;e that are any thing
  conver&#383;ant with &#383;uch Gla&#383;&#383;es, but as to numerous
  Depre&#383;&#383;ions beneath that Level, of which &#383;ort of Cavities
  by the help of a <i>Micro&#383;cope</i>, which the greate&#383;t
  Artificer that makes them, judges to be the greate&#383;t Magnifying
  Gla&#383;s in <i>Europe</i>, except one that equals it, we have on the
  Surface of a thin piece of Cork that appear'd &#383;mooth to the Eye,
  ob&#383;erv'd about &#383;ixty in a Row, within the length of le&#383;s
  then an 31 and 32 part of an Inch, (for the Gla&#383;s takes in no longer
  a &#383;pace at one view) and the&#383;e Cavities (which made that little
  piece of Cork look almo&#383;t like an empty Honey-comb) were not only
  very di&#383;tinct, and figur'd like one another, but of a
  con&#383;iderable bigne&#383;s, and a &#383;carce credible depth;
  in&#383;omuch that their di&#383;tinct &#383;hadows as well as &#383;ides
  were plainly di&#383;cern'd and ea&#383;iy to be reckon'd, and might have
  been well di&#383;tingui&#383;h'd, though they had been ten times
  le&#383;&#383;er than they were; which I thought it not ami&#383;s to
  mention to you <i>Pyrophilus</i> upon the by, that you may thence make
  &#383;ome E&#383;timate, what a &#383;trange Inequality, and what a
  multitude of little Shades, there may really be, in a <!-- Page 28
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28"></a>[pg 28]</span> &#383;carce
  &#383;en&#383;ible part of the Phy&#383;ical &#383;uperficies, though the
  naked Eye &#383;ees no &#383;uch matter. And as Excellent
  <i>Micro&#383;copes</i> &#383;hew us this Ruggedne&#383;s in many Bodies
  that pa&#383;s for Smooth, &#383;o there are divers Experiments, though we
  mu&#383;t not now &#383;tay to urge them, which &#383;eem to
  per&#383;wade us of the &#383;ame thing as to the re&#383;t of &#383;uch
  Bodies as we are now treating off; So, that there is no
  &#383;en&#383;ible part of an Opacous body, that may not be conceiv'd to
  be made up of a multitude of &#383;ingly in&#383;en&#383;ible
  Corpu&#383;cles, but in the giving the&#383;e &#383;urfaces that
  di&#383;po&#383;ition, which makes them alter the Light that reflects
  thence to the Eye after the manner requi&#383;ite to make the Object
  appear Green, Blew, &amp;c. the Figures of the&#383;e Particles have <i>a
  great</i>, but not <i>the only</i> &#383;troak. 'Tis true indeed that the
  protuberant Particles may be of very great variety of Figures, Sphærical,
  Elliptical, Conical, Cylindrical, Polyedrical, and &#383;ome very
  irregular, and that according to the Nature of the&#383;e, and the
  &#383;ituation of the Lucid body, the Light mu&#383;t be variou&#383;ly
  affected, after one manner from Surfaces (I now &#383;peak of
  Phy&#383;ical Surfaces) con&#383;i&#383;ting of Sphaerical, and in
  another from tho&#383;e that are made up of Conical or Cylindrical
  Corpu&#383;cles; &#383;ome <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_29"></a>[pg 29]</span> being fitted to reflect more of the
  incident Beams of Light, others le&#383;s, and &#383;ome towards one
  part, others towards another. But be&#383;ides this difference of Shape,
  there may be divers other things that may eminently concurr to vary the
  forms of A&#383;perity that Colours &#383;o much depend on. For,
  willingly allowing the Figure of the Particles in the fir&#383;t place, I
  con&#383;ider &#383;econdly, that the &#383;uperficial Corpu&#383;cles,
  if I may &#383;o call them, may be bigger in one Body, and le&#383;s in
  another, and con&#383;equently fitted to allay the Light falling on them
  with greater &#383;hades. Next, the protuberant Particles may be &#383;et
  more or le&#383;s clo&#383;e together, that is, there may be a greater or
  a &#383;maller number of them within the compa&#383;s of one, than within
  the compa&#383;s of another &#383;mall part of the Surface of the
  &#383;ame Extent, and how much the&#383;e Qualities may &#383;erve to
  produce Colour may be &#383;omewhat gue&#383;s'd at, by that which
  happens in the Agitation of Water; for if the Bubbles that are thereby
  made be Great, and but Few, the Water will &#383;carce acquire a
  &#383;en&#383;ible Colour, but if it be reduc'd to a Froth,
  con&#383;i&#383;ting of Bubbles, which being very Minute and Contiguous
  to each other, are a multitude of them crowded into a narrow Room, the
  Water (turned to <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_30"></a>[pg 30]</span> Froth) does then exhibit a very
  manife&#383;t White Colour,<a name="NtA_3"></a><a
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>3</sup></a> (to which the&#383;e la&#383;t nam'd
  Conditions of the Bubbles do as well as their Convex figure contribute)
  and that for Rea&#383;ons to be mention'd anon. Be&#383;ides, it is not
  nece&#383;&#383;ary that the Superficial particles that exhibit one
  Colour, &#383;hould be all of them Round, or all Conical, or all of any
  one Shape, but Corpu&#383;cles of differing Figures may be mingled on the
  Surface of the Opacous Body, as when the Corpu&#383;cles that make a Blew
  colour, and tho&#383;e that make a Yellow, come to be Accurately and
  Skilfully mix'd, they make up a Green, which though it &#383;eem one
  &#383;imple Colour, yet in this ca&#383;e appears to be made by
  Corpu&#383;cles of very differing Kinds, duely commix'd. Moreover the
  Figure and Bigne&#383;s of the little Depre&#383;&#383;ions, Cavities,
  Furrows or Pores intercepted betwixt the&#383;e protuberant
  Corpu&#383;cles, are as well to be con&#383;ider'd as the Sizes and
  Shapes of the Corpu&#383;cles them&#383;elves: For we may conceive the
  Phy&#383;ical &#383;uperficies of a Body, where (as we &#383;aid) its
  Colour does as it were re&#383;ide, to be cut Tran&#383;ver&#383;ly by a
  Mathematical plain, which you know is conceiv'd to be without any Depth
  or Thickne&#383;s at all, and then as <!-- Page 31 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"></a>[pg 31]</span> &#383;ome parts of
  the Phy&#383;ical Superficies will be Protuberant; or &#383;well above
  this la&#383;t plain, &#383;o others may be depre&#383;s'd beneath it; as
  (to explane my &#383;elf by a gro&#383;s Compari&#383;on) in divers
  places of the Surface of the Earth, there are not only Neighbouring
  Hills, Trees, &amp;c. that are rais'd above the Horizontal Level of the
  Valley, but Rivers, Wells, Pits and other Cavities that are
  depre&#383;s'd beneath it, and that &#383;uch Protuberant and Concave
  parts of a Surface may remit the Light &#383;o differingly, as much to
  vary a Colour, &#383;ome examples and other things, that we &#383;hall
  hereafter have occa&#383;ion to take notice off in this Tract, will
  &#383;ufficiently declare, till when, it may &#383;uffice to put you in
  mind, that of two Flat-&#383;ides of the &#383;ame piece of, for example,
  red Marble, the one being diligently Poli&#383;hed, and the other left to
  its former Roughne&#383;s, the differing degrees or &#383;orts of
  A&#383;perity, for the &#383;ide that is &#383;mooth to the Touch wants
  not its Roughne&#383;s, will &#383;o diver&#383;ifie the Light reflected
  from the &#383;everal Plains to the Eye, that a Painter would employ two
  differing Colours to repre&#383;ent them.</p>

  <p>7. And I hope, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, you will not think it &#383;trange
  or impertinent, that I employ in divers pa&#383;&#383;ages of the&#383;e
  Papers, <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32"></a>[pg
  32]</span> examples drawn from Bodies and Shadows far more Gro&#383;s,
  than tho&#383;e minute Protuberances and &#383;hady Pores on which in
  mo&#383;t ca&#383;es the Colour of a Body as 'tis an Inherent Quality or
  Di&#383;po&#383;ition of its Surface, &#383;eems to depend. For
  &#383;ometimes I employ &#383;uch Examples, rather to declare my Meaning,
  than prove my Conjecture; things, whom their Smallne&#383;s makes
  In&#383;en&#383;ible, being better repre&#383;ented to the Imagination by
  &#383;uch familiar Objects, as being like them enough in other
  re&#383;pects, are of a Vi&#383;ible bulk. And next, though the Beams of
  Light are &#383;uch &#383;ubtil Bodies, that in re&#383;pect of them,
  even Surfaces that are &#383;en&#383;ibly Smooth, are not exactly
  &#383;o, but have their own degree of Roughne&#383;s,
  con&#383;i&#383;ting of little Protuberances and Depre&#383;&#383;ions;
  and though con&#383;equently &#383;uch Inequalities may &#383;uffice to
  give Bodies differing Colours, as we &#383;ee in Marble that appears
  White or Black, or Red or Blew, even when the mo&#383;t carefully
  Poli&#383;h'd, yet 'tis plain by the late In&#383;tance of Red Marble,
  and many others, that even bigger Protuberances and greater Shades may
  likewi&#383;e &#383;o Diver&#383;ifie the Roughne&#383;s of a Bodies
  Superficies, as manife&#383;tly to concurr to the varying of its Colour,
  whereby &#383;uch Examples appear to be proper enough <!-- Page 33
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33"></a>[pg 33]</span> to be
  employ'd in &#383;uch a Subject as we have now in hand. And having hinted
  thus much on this Occa&#383;ion, I now proceed.</p>

  <p>8. The Situation al&#383;o of the Superficial particles is
  con&#383;iderable, which I di&#383;tingui&#383;h into the Po&#383;ture of
  the &#383;ingle Corpu&#383;cles, in re&#383;pect of the Light, and of the
  Eye, and the Order of them in reference al&#383;o to one another; for a
  Body may otherwi&#383;e reflect the Light, when its Superficial particles
  are more erected upon the Plain that may be conceiv'd to pa&#383;s along
  their Ba&#383;is, and when the Points or Extremes of &#383;uch Particles
  are Obverted to the Eye, than when tho&#383;e Particles are &#383;o
  Inclin'd, that their Sides are in great part Di&#383;cernable, as the
  Colour of Plu&#383;h or Velvet will appear Vary'd to you, if you
  carefully &#383;troak part of it one way, and part of it another, the
  po&#383;ture of the particular Thrids, in reference to the Light, or the
  Eye, becoming thereby different. And you may ob&#383;erve in a Field of
  ripe Corn blown upon by the Wind, that there will appear as it were Waves
  of a Colour (at lea&#383;t Gradually) differing from that of the
  re&#383;t of the Field, the Wind by Depre&#383;&#383;ing &#383;ome of the
  Ears, and not at the &#383;ame time others, making the one Reflect more
  from <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34"></a>[pg
  34]</span> the Lateral and Strawy parts, than do the re&#383;t. And
  &#383;o, when Doggs are &#383;o angry, as to Erect the Hairs upon their
  Necks, and upon &#383;ome other parts of their Bodies, tho&#383;e Parts
  &#383;eem to acquire a Colour vary'd from that which the &#383;ame Hairs
  made, when in their u&#383;ual Po&#383;ture they did farr more
  &#383;toop. And that the Order wherein the Superficial Corpu&#383;cles
  are Rang'd is not to be neglected, we may gue&#383;s by turning of Water
  into Froth, the beating of Gla&#383;s, and the &#383;craping of Horns, in
  which ca&#383;es the Corpu&#383;cles that were before &#383;o
  mar&#383;hall'd as to be Per&#383;picuous, do by the troubling of that
  Order become Di&#383;pos'd to terminate and reflect more Light, and
  thereby to appear Whiti&#383;h. And there are other ways in which the
  Order of the Protuberant parts, in reference to the Eye, may much
  contribute to the appearing of a particular Colour, for I have often
  ob&#383;erv'd, that when Pea&#383;e are Planted, or Set in Parallel
  Lines, and are Shot up about half a Foot above the Surface of the Ground,
  by looking on the Field or Plot of Ground from that part towards which
  the Parallel Lines tended, the greater part of the Ground by farr would
  appear of its own dirty Colour, but if I look'd upon it
  Tran&#383;ver&#383;ly, the Plot <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_35"></a>[pg 35]</span> would appear very Green, the upper
  parts of the Pea&#383;e hindering the intercepted parts of the Ground,
  which as I &#383;aid retain'd their wonted Colour, from being
  di&#383;cover'd by the Eye. And I know not, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, whether I
  might not add, that even the Motion of the Small Parts of a Vi&#383;ible
  Object may in &#383;ome ca&#383;es contribute, though it be not &#383;o
  ea&#383;ie to &#383;ay how, to the Producing or the Varying of a Colour;
  for I have &#383;everal times made a Liquor, which when it has well
  &#383;ettled in a clo&#383;e Vial, is Tran&#383;parent and
  Colourle&#383;s, but as &#383;oon as the Gla&#383;s is un&#383;topp'd,
  begins to fly away very plentifully in a White and Opacous fume; and
  there are other Bodies, who&#383;e Fumes, when they fill a Receiver,
  would make one &#383;u&#383;pect it contains Milk, and yet when
  the&#383;e Fumes &#383;ettle into a Liquor, that Liquor is not White, but
  Tran&#383;parent; And &#383;uch White Fumes I have &#383;een afforded by
  un&#383;topping a Liquor I know, which yet is it &#383;elf Diaphanous and
  Red; Nor are the&#383;e the only In&#383;tances of this Kind, that our
  Tryals can &#383;upply us with. And if the Superficial Corpu&#383;cles be
  of the Gro&#383;&#383;er &#383;ort, and be &#383;o Framed, that their
  differing Sides or Faces may exhibit differing Colours, then the Motion
  or Re&#383;t of tho&#383;e Corpu&#383;cles may be <!-- Page 36 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36"></a>[pg 36]</span> con&#383;iderable,
  as to the Colour of the Superficies they compo&#383;e, upon this account,
  that &#383;ometimes more, &#383;ometimes fewer of the Sides di&#383;pos'd
  to exhibit &#383;uch a Colour may by this means become or continue more
  Obverted to the Eye than the re&#383;t, and compo&#383;e a Phy&#383;ical
  Surface, that will be more or le&#383;s &#383;en&#383;ibly interrupted;
  As, to explane my meaning, by propo&#383;ing a gro&#383;s Example, I
  remember, that in &#383;ome &#383;orts of Leavy Plants thick &#383;et by
  one another, the two &#383;ides of who&#383;e Leaves were of
  &#383;omewhat differing Colours, there would be a notable Di&#383;parity
  as to Colour, if you look'd upon them both when the Leaves being at
  Re&#383;t had their upper and commonly expos'd &#383;ides Obverted to the
  Eye, and when a breath of Wind pa&#383;&#383;ing thorow them, made great
  Numbers of the u&#383;ually Hidden &#383;ides of the Leaves become
  con&#383;picuous. And though the Little Bodies, we were lately
  &#383;peaking of, may Singly and Apart &#383;eem almo&#383;t
  Colourle&#383;s, yet when Many of them are plac'd by one another, &#383;o
  near, that the Eye does not ea&#383;ily di&#383;cern an Interruption,
  within a &#383;en&#383;ible &#383;pace, they may exhibit a Colour; as we
  &#383;ee, that though a Slendere&#383;t Thrid of Dy'd Silk do's,
  whil&#383;t look'd on Single, &#383;eem almo&#383;t quite Devoyd of
  Redne&#383;s, (for in&#383;tance) <!-- Page 37 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"></a>[pg 37]</span> yet when numbers of
  the&#383;e Thrids are brought together into one Skein, their Colour
  becomes notorious.</p>

  <p>9. But the &#383;ame Occa&#383;ion that invited me to &#383;ay what I
  have mention'd concerning the Leaves of Trees, invites me al&#383;o to
  give you &#383;ome account of what happens in Changeable Taffities, where
  we &#383;ee differing Colours, as it were, Emerge and Vani&#383;h upon
  the Ruffling of the &#383;ame piece of Silk: As I have divers times with
  Plea&#383;ure ob&#383;erv'd, by the help of &#383;uch a
  <i>Micro&#383;cope</i>, as, though it do not very much Magnifie the
  Object, has in recompence this great Conveniency, that you may
  ea&#383;ily, as fa&#383;t as you plea&#383;e, remove it from one part to
  another of a Large Object, of which the Gla&#383;s taking a great part at
  once, you may thereby pre&#383;ently Survey the Whole. Now by the help of
  &#383;uch a <i>Micro&#383;cope</i> I could ea&#383;ily (as I began to
  &#383;ay) di&#383;cern, that in a piece of Changeable Taffity, (that
  appear'd, for In&#383;tance, &#383;ometimes Red, and &#383;ometimes
  Green) the Stuff was compos'd of Red thrids and Green, pa&#383;&#383;ing
  under and over each other, and cro&#383;&#383;ing one another in
  almo&#383;t innumerable points; and if I look'd through the Gla&#383;s
  upon any con&#383;iderable portion of the Stuff, that (for example
  &#383;ake) to the <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_38"></a>[pg 38]</span> naked Eye appear'd to be Red, I could
  plainly &#383;ee, that in that Po&#383;ition, the Red thrids were
  Con&#383;picuous, and reflected a vivid Light; and though I could
  al&#383;o perceive, that there were Green ones, yet by rea&#383;on of
  their di&#383;advantagious Po&#383;ition in the <i>Phy&#383;ical
  Surface</i> of the Taffity, they were in part hid by the more Protuberant
  Thrids of the other Colour; and for the &#383;ame cau&#383;e, the
  Reflection from as much of the Green as was di&#383;cover'd, was
  comparatively but Dim and Faint. And if, on the contrary, I look'd
  through the <i>Micro&#383;cope</i> upon any part that appear'd Green, I
  could plainly &#383;ee that the Red thrids were le&#383;s fully expos'd
  to the Eye, and ob&#383;cur'd by the Green ones, which therefore made up
  the Predominant Colour. And by ob&#383;erving the Texture of the Silken
  Stuff, I could ea&#383;i&#383;y &#383;o expo&#383;e the Thrids either of
  the one Colour or of the other to my Eye, as at plea&#383;ure to exhibit
  an apparition of Red or Green, or make tho&#383;e Colours &#383;ucceed
  one another: So that, when I ob&#383;erv'd their Succe&#383;&#383;ion by
  the help of the Gla&#383;s, I could mark how the Predominant Colour did
  as it were &#383;tart out, when the Thrids that exhibited it came to be
  advanagiou&#383;ly plac'd; And by making little Folds in the Stuff after
  a certain manner, <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_39"></a>[pg 39]</span> the Sides that met and terminated in
  tho&#383;e Folds, would appear to the naked Eye, one of them Red, and the
  other Green. When Thrids of more than two differing Colours chance to be
  Interwoven, the re&#383;ulting changeablene&#383;s of the Taffity may be
  al&#383;o &#383;omewhat different. But I choo&#383;e to give an
  In&#383;tance in the Stuff I have been &#383;peaking off, becau&#383;e
  the mixture being more Simple, the way whereby the Changeablene&#383;s is
  produc'd, may be the more ea&#383;ily apprehended: and though Rea&#383;on
  alone might readily enough lead a con&#383;idering Man to gue&#383;s at
  the Explication, in ca&#383;e he knew how Changeable Taffities are made:
  yet I thought it not impertinent to mention it, becau&#383;e both
  Scholars and Gentlemen are wont to look upon the Inquiry into
  Manufactures, as a <i>Mechanick</i> imployment, and con&#383;equently
  below Them; and becau&#383;e al&#383;o with &#383;uch a
  <i>Micro&#383;cope</i> as I have been mentioning, the di&#383;covery is
  as well Plea&#383;ant as Satisfactory, and may afford Hints of the
  Solution of other <i>Phænomena</i> of Colours. And it were not
  ami&#383;s, that &#383;ome diligent Inquiry were made, whether the
  <i>Micro&#383;cope</i> would give us an account of the Variablene&#383;s
  of Colour, that is &#383;o Con&#383;picuous and &#383;o Delightfull in
  Mother of Pearl, in Opalls, and &#383;ome <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40"></a>[pg 40]</span> other
  re&#383;embling Bodies: For though I remember I did formerly attempt
  &#383;omething of that Kind (fruitle&#383;ly enough) upon Mother of
  Pearl, yet not having then the advantage of my be&#383;t
  <i>Micro&#383;cope</i>, nor &#383;ome Conveniences that might have been
  wi&#383;h'd, I leave it to you, who have better Eyes, to try what you can
  do further; &#383;ince 'twill be <i>Some</i> di&#383;covery to find,
  that, in this ca&#383;e, the be&#383;t Eyes and <i>Micro&#383;copes</i>
  them&#383;elves can make <i>None</i>.</p>

  <p>10. I confe&#383;s, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, that a great part of what I
  have deliver'd, (or propos'd rather) concerning the differing forms of
  A&#383;perity in Bodies, by which Differences the incident Light either
  comes to be Reflected with more or le&#383;s of Shade, and with that
  Shade more or le&#383;s Interrupted, or el&#383;e happens to be al&#383;o
  otherwi&#383;e Modify'd or Troubl'd, is but Conjectural. But I am not
  &#383;ure, that if it were not for the Dullne&#383;s of our Sen&#383;es,
  either the&#383;e or &#383;ome other Notions of Kin to them, might be
  better Countenanc'd; for I am apt to &#383;u&#383;pect, that if we were
  Sharp &#383;ighted enough, or had &#383;uch perfect
  <i>Micro&#383;copes</i>, as I fear are more to be wi&#383;h'd than hop'd
  for, our promoted Sen&#383;e might di&#383;cern in the Phy&#383;ical
  Surfaces of Bodies, both a great many latent Ruggidne&#383;&#383;es, and
  the particular <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_41"></a>[pg 41]</span> Sizes, Shapes, and Situations of the
  extremely little Bodies that cau&#383;e them, and perhaps might perceive
  among other Varieties that we now can but imagine, how tho&#383;e little
  Protuberances and Cavities do Interrupt and Dilate the Light, by mingling
  with it a multitude of little and &#383;ingly undi&#383;cernable Shades,
  though &#383;ome of them more, and &#383;ome of them le&#383;s Minute,
  &#383;ome le&#383;s, and &#383;ome more Numerous; according to the Nature
  and Degree of the particular Colour we attribute to the Vi&#383;ible
  Object; as we &#383;ee, that in the Moon we can with Excellent
  <i>Tele&#383;copes</i> di&#383;cern many Hills and Vallies, and as it
  were Pits and other Parts, whereof &#383;ome are more, and &#383;ome
  le&#383;s Vividly illu&#383;trated, and others have a fainter, others a
  deeper Shade, though the naked Eye can di&#383;cern no &#383;uch matter
  in that Planet. And with an Excellent <i>Micro&#383;cope</i>, where the
  <i>Naked</i> Eye did &#383;ee but a Green powder, the
  <i>A&#383;&#383;isted</i> Eye as we noted above, could di&#383;cern
  particular Granules, &#383;ome of them of a Blew, and &#383;ome of them
  of a Yellow colour, which Corpu&#383;cles we had beforehand caus'd to be
  exqui&#383;itly mix'd to compound the Green.</p>

  <p>11. And, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, that you may not think me altogether
  extravagant in what I <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_42"></a>[pg 42]</span> have &#383;aid of the
  Po&#383;&#383;ibility, (for I &#383;peak of no more) of di&#383;cerning
  the differing forms of A&#383;perity in the Surfaces of Bodies of
  &#383;everal Colours, I'l here &#383;et down a Memorable particular that
  chanc'd to come to my Knowledge, &#383;ince I writ a good part of this
  <i>E&#383;&#383;ay</i>; and it is this. Meeting ca&#383;ually the other
  Day with the de&#383;ervedly Famous<a name="NtA_4"></a><a
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Dr. <i>J. Finch</i>, Extraordinary
  <i>Anatomi&#383;t</i> to that Great Patron of the <i>Virtuo&#383;i</i>,
  the now Great Duke of <i>To&#383;cany</i>, and enquiring of this
  Ingenious Per&#383;on, what might be the chief Rarity he had &#383;een in
  his late return out of <i>Italy</i> into <i>England</i>, he told me, it
  was a Man at <i>Mae&#383;tricht</i> in the Low-Countrys, who at certain
  times can di&#383;cern and <i>di&#383;tingui&#383;h Colours by the
  Touch</i> with his Fingers. You'l ea&#383;ily Conclude, that this is farr
  more &#383;trange, than what I propos'd but as <i>not
  Impo&#383;&#383;ible</i>; &#383;ince the Sen&#383;e of the <i>Retina</i>
  &#383;eeming to be much more Tender and quick than that of tho&#383;e
  Gro&#383;&#383;er Filaments, Nerves or Membranes of our Fingers,
  wherewith we u&#383;e to handle Gro&#383;s and Hard Bodies, it &#383;eems
  &#383;carce credible, that any Accu&#383;tomance, or Diet, or peculiarity
  of Con&#383;titution, &#383;hould enable a Man to di&#383;tingui&#383;h
  <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43"></a>[pg
  43]</span> with &#383;uch Gro&#383;s and Un&#383;uitable Organs,
  &#383;uch Nice and Subtile Differences as tho&#383;e of the forms of
  A&#383;perity, that belong to differing Colours, to receive who&#383;e
  Languid and Delicate Impre&#383;&#383;ions by the Intervention of Light,
  Nature &#383;eems to have appointed and contexed into the <i>Retina</i>
  the tender and delicate Pith of the Optick Nerve. Wherefore I
  confe&#383;s, I propos'd divers Scruples, and particularly whether the
  Doctor had taken care to bind a Napkin or Hankerchief over his Eyes
  &#383;o carefully, as to be &#383;ure he could make no u&#383;e of his
  Sight, though he had but Counterfeited the want of it, to which I added
  divers other Que&#383;tions, to &#383;atisfie my Self, whether there were
  any Likelihood of Collu&#383;ion or other Tricks. But I found that the
  Judicious Doctor having gone farr out of his way, purpo&#383;ely to
  &#383;atisfie Him&#383;elf and his Learned Prince about this Wonder, had
  been very Watchfull and Circum&#383;pect to keep <i>Him&#383;elf</i> from
  being Impos'd upon. And that he might not through any mi&#383;take in
  point of Memory mis-inform <i>Me</i>, he did me the Favour at my
  Reque&#383;t, to look out the Notes he had Written for his Own and his
  Princes Information, the &#383;umm of which Memorials, as far as we
  &#383;hall mention them here, was this, That the Doctor <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44"></a>[pg 44]</span> having been
  inform'd at <i>Utrecht</i>, that there Lived one at &#383;ome Miles
  di&#383;tance from <i>Maestricht</i>, who could di&#383;tingui&#383;h
  Colours by the Touch, when he came to the la&#383;t nam'd Town, he
  &#383;ent a Me&#383;&#383;enger for him, and having Examin'd him, was
  told upon Enquiry the&#383;e Particulars:</p>

  <p>That the Man's name was <i>John Vermaa&#383;en</i>, at that time about
  33 Years of Age; that when he was but two years Old, he had the Small
  Pox, which rendred him ab&#383;olutely Blind: That at this pre&#383;ent
  he is an <i>Organi&#383;t</i>, and &#383;erves that Office in a publick
  Quire.</p>

  <p>That the Doctor di&#383;cour&#383;ing with him over Night, the Blind
  man affirm'd, that he could di&#383;tingui&#383;h Colours by the Touch,
  but that he could not do it, unle&#383;s he were Fa&#383;ting; Any
  quantity of Drink taking from him that Exqui&#383;itne&#383;s of Touch,
  which is requi&#383;ite to &#383;o Nice a Sen&#383;ation.</p>

  <p>That hereupon the Doctor provided again&#383;t the next Morning
  &#383;even pieces of Ribbon, of the&#383;e &#383;even Colours, Black,
  White, Red, Blew, Green, Yellow, and Gray, but as for <i>mingled</i>
  Colours, this <i>Vermaa&#383;en</i> would not undertake to di&#383;cern
  them, though if offer'd, he would tell that they were <i>Mix'd</i>.</p>

  <p>That to di&#383;cern the Colour of the Ribbon, <!-- Page 45 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45"></a>[pg 45]</span> he places it betwixt
  the Thumb and the Fore-finger, but his mo&#383;t exqui&#383;ite
  perception was in his Thumb, and much better in the right Thumb than in
  the left.</p>

  <p>That after the Blind man had four or five times told the Doctor the
  &#383;everal Colours, (though Blinded with a Napkin for fear he might
  have &#383;ome Sight) the Doctor found he was twice mi&#383;taken, for he
  call'd the White Black, and the Red Blew, but &#383;till, he, before his
  Errour, would lay them by in Pairs, &#383;aying, that though he could
  ea&#383;ily di&#383;tingui&#383;h them from all others, yet tho&#383;e
  two Pairs were not ea&#383;ily di&#383;tingui&#383;h'd among&#383;t
  them&#383;elves, whereupon the Doctor de&#383;ir'd to be told by him what
  kind of Di&#383;crimination he had of Colours by his Touch, to which he
  gave a reply, for who&#383;e &#383;ake chiefly I in&#383;ert all this
  Narrative in this place, namely, That all the difference was more or
  le&#383;s A&#383;perity, for &#383;ays he, (I give you the Doctor's own
  words) Black feels as if you were feeling Needles points, or &#383;ome
  har&#383;h Sand, and Red feels very Smooth.</p>

  <p>That the Doctor having de&#383;ir'd him to tell in Order the
  difference of Colours to his Touch, he did as follows;</p>

  <p>Black and White are the mo&#383;t a&#383;perous <!-- Page 46 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46"></a>[pg 46]</span> or unequal of all
  Colours, and &#383;o like, that 'tis very hard to di&#383;tingui&#383;h
  them, but Black is the mo&#383;t Rough of the two, Green is next in
  A&#383;perity, Gray next to Green in A&#383;perity, Yellow is the fifth
  in degree of A&#383;perity, Red and Blew are &#383;o like, that they are
  as hard to di&#383;tingui&#383;h as Black and White, but Red is
  &#383;omewhat more A&#383;perous than Blew, &#383;o that Red has the
  &#383;ixth place, and Blew the &#383;eventh in A&#383;perity.</p>

  <p>12. To the&#383;e Informations the Obliging Doctor was pleas'd to add
  the welcome pre&#383;ent of three of tho&#383;e very pieces of Ribbon,
  who&#383;e Colours in his pre&#383;ence the Blind man had
  di&#383;tingui&#383;hed, pronouncing the one Gray, the other Red, and the
  third Green, which I keep by me as Rarities, and the rather, becau&#383;e
  he fear'd the re&#383;t were mi&#383;carry'd.</p>

  <p>13. Before I &#383;aw the Notes that afforded me the precedent
  Narrative, I confe&#383;s I &#383;u&#383;pected this man might have thus
  di&#383;criminated Colours, rather by the Smell than by the Touch; for
  &#383;ome of the Ingredients imployed by Dyers to Colour things, have
  Sents, that are not &#383;o Languid, nor &#383;o near of Kin, but that I
  thought it not impo&#383;&#383;ible that a very Critical No&#383;e might
  di&#383;tingui&#383;h them, and this I the rather &#383;u&#383;pected,
  becau&#383;e he requir'd, that the Ribbons, <!-- Page 47 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47"></a>[pg 47]</span> who&#383;e Colours
  he was to Name, &#383;hould be offer'd him Fa&#383;ting in the morning;
  for I have ob&#383;erv'd in Setting Doggs, that the feeding of them
  (especially with &#383;ome &#383;orts of Aliments) does very much impair
  the exqui&#383;ite &#383;ent of their No&#383;es. And though &#383;ome of
  the foregoing particulars would have prevented that Conjecture, yet I
  confe&#383;s to you (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) that I would gladly have had the
  Opportunity of Examining this Man my &#383;elf, and of Que&#383;tioning
  him about divers particulars which I do not find to have been yet thought
  upon. And though it be not incredible to me, that &#383;ince the Liquors
  that Dyers imploy to tinge, are qualifi'd to do &#383;o by multitudes of
  little Corpu&#383;cles of the Pigment or Dying &#383;tuff, which are
  di&#383;&#383;olved and extracted by the Liquor, and &#383;wim to and fro
  in it, tho&#383;e Corpu&#383;cles of Colour (as the <i>Atomi&#383;ts</i>
  call them) in&#383;inuating them&#383;elves into, and filling all the
  Pores of the Body to be Dyed, may A&#383;perate its Superficies more or
  le&#383;s according to the Bigne&#383;s and Texture of the
  Corpu&#383;cles of the Pigment; yet I can &#383;carce believe, that our
  Blind man could di&#383;tingui&#383;h all the Colours he did, meerly by
  the Ribbons having more or le&#383;s of A&#383;perity, &#383;o that I
  cannot but think, notwith&#383;tanding this Hi&#383;tory, that the Blind
  man <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48"></a>[pg
  48]</span> di&#383;tingui&#383;h'd Colours not only by the <i>Degrees</i>
  of A&#383;perity in the Bodies offer'd to him, but by <i>Forms</i> of it,
  though this (latter) would perhaps have been very difficult for him to
  make an Intelligible mention of, becau&#383;e tho&#383;e Minute
  di&#383;parities having not been taken notice of by men for want of touch
  as Exqui&#383;ite as our Blind Mans, are things he could not have
  Intelligibly expre&#383;s'd, which will ea&#383;ily &#383;eem Probable,
  if you con&#383;ider, that under the name of Sharp, and Sweet, and Sour,
  there are abundance of, as it were, immediate peculiar Reli&#383;hes or
  Ta&#383;ts in differing &#383;orts of Wine, which though Critical and
  Experienc'd Palats can ea&#383;ily di&#383;cern them&#383;elves cannot
  make them be under&#383;tood by others, &#383;uch Minute differences not
  having hitherto any Di&#383;tinct names a&#383;&#383;ign'd them. And it
  &#383;eems that there was &#383;omthing in the Forms of A&#383;perity
  that was requi&#383;ite to the Di&#383;tinction of Colours, be&#383;ides
  the Degree of it, &#383;ince he found it &#383;o difficult to
  di&#383;tingu&#383;h Black and White from one another, though not from
  other Colours. For I might urge, that he &#383;eems not con&#383;onant to
  him&#383;elf about the <i>Red</i>, which as you have &#383;een in one
  place, he repre&#383;ents as &#383;omewhat more A&#383;perous than the
  <i>Blew</i>; and in another, very Smooth: But becau&#383;e he &#383;peaks
  of this Smoothne&#383;s in that place, <!-- Page 49 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49"></a>[pg 49]</span> where he mentions
  the Roughne&#383;s of <i>Black</i>, we may favourably pre&#383;ume that
  he might mean but a <i>comparative Smoothne&#383;s</i>; and therefore I
  &#383;hall not In&#383;i&#383;t on this, but rather Countenance my
  Conjecture by this, that he found it &#383;o Difficult, not only, to
  Di&#383;criminate Red and Blew, (though the fir&#383;t of our
  promi&#383;cuous Experiments will inform you, that the Red reflects by
  great Odds more Light than the other) but al&#383;o to
  di&#383;tingui&#383;h Black and White from one another, though not from
  other Colours. And indeed, though in the Ribbonds that were offer'd him,
  they might be almo&#383;t equally Rough, yet in &#383;uch &#383;lender
  Corpu&#383;cles as tho&#383;e of Colour, there may ea&#383;ily enough be
  Conceiv'd, not only a greater Clo&#383;ene&#383;s of Parts, or el&#383;e
  Paucity of Protuberant Corpu&#383;cles, and the little extant Particles
  may be otherwi&#383;e Figur'd, and Rang'd in the White than in the Black,
  but the Cavities may be much Deeper in the one than the other.</p>

  <p>14. And perhaps, (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) it may prove &#383;ome
  <i>Illu&#383;tration of what I mean</i>, and help you to conceive how
  <i>this may</i> be, if I Repre&#383;ent, that where the Particles are
  &#383;o exceeding Slender, we may allow the Parts expos'd to the Sight
  and Touch to be a little Convex in compari&#383;on of the Erected <!--
  Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50"></a>[pg 50]</span>
  Particle of Black Bodies, as if there were Wyres I know not how many
  times Slenderer than a Hair: whether you &#383;uppo&#383;e them to be
  Figur'd like Needles, or Cylindrically, like the Hairs of a Bru&#383;h,
  with Hemi&#383;phærical (or at lea&#383;t Convex) Tops, they will be
  &#383;o very Slender, and con&#383;equently the Points both of the one
  &#383;ort and the other &#383;o very Sharp, that even an exqui&#383;ite
  Touch will be able to di&#383;tingui&#383;h no greater Difference between
  them, than that which our Blind man allow'd, when comparing Black and
  White Bodies, he &#383;aid, that the latter was the le&#383;s Rough of
  the two. Nor is every Kind of Roughne&#383;s, though Sen&#383;ible
  enough, Incon&#383;i&#383;tent with Whitene&#383;s, there being
  Ca&#383;es, wherein the Phy&#383;ical Superficies of a Body is made by
  the &#383;ame Operation both <i>Rough</i> and <i>white</i>, as when the
  Level Surface of clear Water being by agitation A&#383;perated with a
  multitude of Unequal Bubbles, do's thereby acquire a Whitene&#383;s; and
  as a Smooth piece of Gla&#383;s, by being Scratch'd with a Diamond, do's
  in the A&#383;perated part of its Surface di&#383;clo&#383;e the
  &#383;ame Colour. But more (perchance) of this el&#383;ewhere.</p>

  <p>15. And therefore, we &#383;hall here pa&#383;s by the Que&#383;tion,
  whether any thing might <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_51"></a>[pg 51]</span> be con&#383;ider'd about the Opacity of
  the Corpu&#383;cles of Black Pigments, and the <i>Comparative</i>
  Diaphaneity of tho&#383;e of many White Bodies, apply'd to our
  pre&#383;ent Ca&#383;e; and proceed, to repre&#383;ent, That the newly
  mention'd Exiguity and Shape of the extant Particles being &#383;uppos'd,
  it will then be con&#383;iderable what we lately but Hinted, (and
  therefore mu&#383;t now &#383;omewhat Explane) That the Depth of the
  little Cavities, intercepted between the extant Particles, without being
  &#383;o much greater in Black Bodies than in White ones, as to be
  perceptibly &#383;o to the Gro&#383;s Organs of Touch, may be very much
  greater in reference to their Di&#383;po&#383;ition of Reflecting the
  imaginary &#383;ubtile Beams of Light. For in Black Bodies, tho&#383;e
  Little intercepted Cavities, and other Depre&#383;&#383;ions, may be
  &#383;o Figur'd, &#383;o Narrow and &#383;o Deep, that the incident Beams
  of Light, which the more extant Parts of the Phy&#383;ical Superficies
  are di&#383;pos'd to Reflect inwards, may be Detain'd there, and prove
  unable to Emerge; whil&#383;t in a White Body, the Slender Particles may
  not only by their Figure be fitted to Reflect the Light copiou&#383;ly
  outwards, but the intercepted Cavities being not Deep, nor perhaps very
  Narrow, the Bottoms of them may be &#383;o Con&#383;tituted, as to <!--
  Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52"></a>[pg 52]</span> be
  fit to Reflect outwards much of the Light that falls even upon Them; as
  you may po&#383;&#383;ibly better apprehend, when we &#383;hall come to
  treat of Whitene&#383;s and Blackne&#383;s. In the mean time it may
  &#383;uffice, that you take Notice with me, that the Blind mans Relations
  import no nece&#383;&#383;ity of Concluding, that, though, becau&#383;e,
  according to the Judgment of his Touch, Black was the Roughe&#383;t, as
  it is the Darke&#383;t of Colours, therefore White, which (according to
  us) is the Lighte&#383;t, &#383;hould be al&#383;o the Smoothe&#383;t:
  &#383;ince I ob&#383;erve, that he makes Yellow to be two Degrees more
  A&#383;perous than Blew, and as much le&#383;s A&#383;perous than Green;
  whereas indeed, Yellow do's not only appear to the Eye a Lighter Colour
  than Blew, but (by our fir&#383;t Experiment hereafter to be mention'd)
  it will appear, that Yellow reflected much more Light than Blew, and
  manife&#383;tly more than Green, (which we need not much wonder at,
  &#383;ince in this Colour and the two others (Blew and Yellow) 'tis not
  <i>only</i> the <i>Reflected Light</i> that is to be con&#383;idered,
  &#383;ince to produce both the&#383;e, <i>Refraction</i> &#383;eems to
  Intervene, which by its Varieties may much alter the Ca&#383;e:) which
  both &#383;eems to &#383;trengthen the Conjecture I was formerly
  propo&#383;ing, that there was &#383;omething el&#383;e <!-- Page 53
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53"></a>[pg 53]</span> in the
  <i>Kinds</i> of A&#383;perity, as well as in the <i>Degrees</i> of it,
  which enabled our Blind man to Di&#383;criminate Colours, and do's at
  lea&#383;t &#383;how, that we cannot in all Ca&#383;es from the bare
  Difference in the Degrees of A&#383;perity betwixt Colours, &#383;afely
  conclude, that the Rougher of any two always Reflects the lea&#383;t
  Light.</p>

  <p>16. But this notwith&#383;tanding, (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) and what ever
  Curio&#383;ity I may have had to move &#383;ome Que&#383;tions to our
  Sagacious Blind man, yet thus much I think you will admit us to have
  gain'd by his Te&#383;timony, that &#383;ince many Colours may be felt
  with the Circum&#383;tances above related, the Surfaces of &#383;uch
  Coloured Bodies mu&#383;t certainly have differing <i>Degrees</i>, and in
  all probability have differing <i>Forms</i> or Kinds of A&#383;perity
  belonging to them, which is all the U&#383;e that my pre&#383;ent attempt
  obliges me to make of the Hi&#383;tory above deliver'd, that being
  &#383;ufficient to prove, <i>that</i> Colour do's much depend upon the
  Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the Superficial parts of Bodies, and to
  &#383;hew in general, <i>wherein</i> 'tis probable that &#383;uch a
  Di&#383;po&#383;ition do's (principally at lea&#383;t)
  con&#383;i&#383;t.</p>

  <p>17. But to return to what I was &#383;aying before I began to make
  mention of our Blind <i>Organi&#383;t</i>, what we have deliver'd <!--
  Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
  touching the cau&#383;es of the &#383;everal Forms or A&#383;perity that
  may Diver&#383;ifie the Surfaces of Colour'd Bodies, may perchance
  &#383;omewhat a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t us to make &#383;ome Conjectures in
  the general, at &#383;everal of the ways whereby 'tis po&#383;&#383;ible
  for the Experiments hereafter to be mention'd, to produce the
  &#383;uddain changes of Colours that are wont to be Con&#383;equent upon
  them; for mo&#383;t of the&#383;e <i>Phænomena</i> being produc'd by the
  Intervention of Liquors, and the&#383;e for the mo&#383;t part abounding
  with very Minute, Active, and Variou&#383;ly Figur'd Saline
  Corpu&#383;cles, Liquors &#383;o Qualify'd may well enough very Nimbly
  after the Texture of the Body they are imploy'd to Work upon, and &#383;o
  may change the form of A&#383;perity, and thereby make them Remit to the
  Eye the Light that falls on them, after another manner than they did
  before, and by that means Vary the Colour, &#383;o farr forth as it
  depends upon the Texture or Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the Seen Parts of
  the Object, which I &#383;ay, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, that you may not think I
  would ab&#383;olutely exclude all other ways of Modifying the Beams of
  Light between their Parting from the Lucid Body, and their Reception into
  the common Sen&#383;ory.</p>

  <p>18. Now there &#383;eem to me divers ways, <!-- Page 55 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"></a>[pg 55]</span> by which we may
  conceive that Liquors may Nimbly alter the Colour of one another, and of
  other Bodies, upon which they Act, but my pre&#383;ent ha&#383;te will
  allow me to mention but &#383;ome of them, without In&#383;i&#383;ting
  &#383;o much as upon tho&#383;e I &#383;hall name.</p>

  <p>19. And fir&#383;t, the Minute Corpu&#383;cles that compo&#383;e a
  Liquor may early in&#383;inuate them&#383;elves into tho&#383;e Pores of
  Bodies, whereto their Size and Figure makes them Congruous, and
  the&#383;e Pores they may either exactly Fill, or but Inadequately, and
  in this latter Ca&#383;e they will for the mo&#383;t part alter the
  Number and Figure, and always the Bigne&#383;s of the former Pores. And
  in what capacity &#383;oever the&#383;e Corpu&#383;cles of a Liquor come
  to be Lodg'd or Harbour'd in the Pores that admit them, the Surface of
  the Body will for the mo&#383;t part have its A&#383;perity alter'd, and
  the Incident Light that meets with a Gro&#383;&#383;er Liquor in the
  little Cavities that before contain'd nothing but Air, or &#383;ome yet
  Subtiler Fluid, will have its Beams either Refracted, or Imbib'd, or
  el&#383;e Reflected more or le&#383;s Interruptedly, than they would be,
  if the Body had been Unmoi&#383;tned, as we &#383;ee, that even fair
  Water falling on white Paper, or Linnen, and divers other Bodies <!--
  Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56"></a>[pg 56]</span> apt
  to &#383;oak it in, will for &#383;ome &#383;uch Rea&#383;ons as
  tho&#383;e newly mention'd, immediately alter the Colour of them, and for
  the mo&#383;t part make it Sadder than that of the Unwetted Parts of the
  &#383;ame Bodies. And &#383;o you may &#383;ee, that when in the Summer
  the High-ways are Dry and Du&#383;ty, if there falls &#383;tore of Rain,
  they will quickly appear of a much Darker Colour than they did before,
  and if a Drop of Oyl be let fall upon a Sheet of White Paper, that part
  of it, which by the Imbibition of the Liquor acquires a greater
  Continuity, and &#383;ome Tran&#383;parency, will appear much Darker than
  the re&#383;t, many of the Incident Beams of Light being now
  Tran&#383;mitted, that otherwi&#383;e would be Reflected towards the
  Beholders Eyes.</p>

  <p>20. Secondly, A Liquor may alter the Colour of a Body by freeing it
  from tho&#383;e things that hindred it from appearing in its Genuine
  Colour; and though this may be &#383;aid to be rather a Re&#383;tauration
  of a Body to its own Colour, or a Retection of its native Colour, than a
  Change, yet &#383;till there Intervenes in it a change of the Colour
  which the Body appear'd to be of before this Operation. And &#383;uch a
  change a Liquor may work, either by Di&#383;&#383;olving, or Corroding,
  or by &#383;ome &#383;uch way of <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_57"></a>[pg 57]</span> carrying off that Matter, which either
  Veil'd or Di&#383;guis'd the Colour that afterwards appears. Thus we
  re&#383;tore Old pieces of Dirty Gold to a clean and nitid Yellow, by
  putting them into the Fire, and into <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, which take off
  the adventitious Filth that made that pure Metall look of a Dirty Colour.
  And there is al&#383;o an ea&#383;ie way to re&#383;tore Silver Coyns to
  their due Lu&#383;tre, by fetching off that which Di&#383;colour'd them.
  And I know a <i>Chymical</i> Liquor, which I employ'd to re&#383;tore
  pieces of Cloath &#383;potted with Grea&#383;e to their proper Colour, by
  Imbibing the Spotted part with this Liquor, which Incorporating with the
  Grea&#383;e, and yet being of a very Volatile Nature, does ea&#383;ily
  carry it away with it Self. And I have &#383;ometimes try'd, that by
  Rubbing upon a good Touch-&#383;tone a certain <i>Metalline</i> mixture
  &#383;o Compounded, that the Impre&#383;&#383;ion it left upon the Stone
  appear'd of a very differing Colour from that of Gold, yet a little of
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i> would in a Trice make the Golden Colour
  di&#383;clo&#383;e it &#383;elf, by Di&#383;&#383;olving the other
  <i>Metalline</i> Corpu&#383;cles that conceal'd tho&#383;e of the Gold,
  which you know that <i>Menstruum</i> will leave Untouch'd.</p>

  <p>21. Thirdly, A Liquor may alter the <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58"></a>[pg 58]</span> Colour of a Body by
  making a Comminution of its Parts, and that principally two ways, the
  fir&#383;t by Di&#383;joyning and Di&#383;&#383;ipating tho&#383;e
  Clu&#383;ters of Particles, if I may &#383;o call them, which &#383;tuck
  more Loo&#383;ely together, being fa&#383;tned only by &#383;ome more
  ea&#383;ily Di&#383;&#383;oluble Ciment, which &#383;eems to be the
  Ca&#383;e of &#383;ome of the following Experiments, where you'l find the
  Colour of many Corpu&#383;cles brought to cohere by having been
  Precipitated together, De&#383;troy'd by the Affu&#383;ion of very
  peircing and inci&#383;ive Liquors. The other of the two ways I was
  &#383;peaking of, is, by Dividing the Gro&#383;&#383;er and more Solid
  Particles into Minute ones, which will be always Le&#383;&#383;er, and
  for the mo&#383;t part otherwi&#383;e Shap'd than the Entire
  Corpu&#383;cle &#383;o Divided, as it will happen in a piece of Wood
  reduc'd into Splinters or Chips, or as when a piece of Chry&#383;tal
  heated red Hot and quench'd in Cold water is crack'd into a multitude of
  little Fragments, which though they fall not a&#383;under, alter the
  Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the Body of the Chry&#383;tal, as to its manner
  of Reflecting the Light, as we &#383;hall have Occa&#383;ion to &#383;hew
  hereafter.</p>

  <p>22. There is a fourth way contrary to the third, whereby a Liquor may
  change the Colour of another Body, e&#383;pecially of <!-- Page 59
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59"></a>[pg 59]</span> another
  Fluid, and that is, by procuring the Coalition of &#383;everal Particles
  that before lay too Scatter'd and Di&#383;pers'd to exhibit the Colour
  that afterwards appears. Thus &#383;ometimes when I have had a Solution
  of Gold &#383;o Dilated, that I doubted whether the Liquor had really
  Imbib'd any true Gold or no, by pouring in a little <i>Mercury</i>, I
  have been quickly able to &#383;atisfie my Self, that the Liquor
  contain'd Gold, that Mettall after a little while Cloathing the Surface
  of the <i>Quick-&#383;ilver</i>, with a Thin Film of its own Livery. And
  chiefly, though not only by this way of bringing the Minute parts of
  Bodies together in &#383;uch Numbers as to make them become Notorious to
  the Eye, many of the&#383;e Colours &#383;eem to be Generated which are
  produc'd by Precipitations, e&#383;pecially by &#383;uch as are wont to
  be made with fair Water, as when Re&#383;inous Gumms di&#383;&#383;olv'd
  in Spirit of Wine, are let fall again, if the Spirit be Copiou&#383;ly
  diluted with that weakning Liquor. And &#383;o out of the Rectify'd and
  Tran&#383;parent Butter of <i>Antimony</i>, by the bare Mixture of fair
  Water, there will be plentifully Precipitated that Milk-white
  Sub&#383;tance, which by having its Loo&#383;er Salts well wa&#383;h'd
  off, is turn'd into that Medicine, which Vulgar <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> are
  pleas'd to call <i>Mercurius Vitæ.</i></p>

<!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60"></a>[pg 60]</span>

  <p>23. A fifth way, by which a Liquor may change the Colour of a Body,
  is, by Di&#383;locating the Parts, and putting them out of their former
  Order into another, and perhaps al&#383;o altering the Po&#383;ture of
  the &#383;ingle Corpu&#383;cles as well as their Order or Situation in
  re&#383;pect of one another. What certain Kinds of Commotion or
  Di&#383;location of the Parts of a Body may do towards the Changing its
  Colour, is not only evident in the Mutations of Colour ob&#383;ervable in
  <i>Quick-&#383;ilver</i>, and &#383;ome other Concretes long kept by
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> in a Convenient Heat, though in clo&#383;e
  Ve&#383;&#383;els, but in the Obvious Degenerations of Colour, which
  every Body may take notice of in Bruis'd Cherries, and other Fruit, by
  comparing after a while the Colour of the Injur'd with that of the Sound
  part of the &#383;ame Fruit. And that al&#383;o &#383;uch Liquors, as we
  have been &#383;peaking of, may greatly Di&#383;compo&#383;e the Textures
  of many Bodies, and thereby alter the Di&#383;po&#383;ition of their
  Superficial parts, the great Commotion made in Metalls, and &#383;everal
  other Bodies by <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, Oyl of <i>Vitriol</i>, and other
  Saline <i>Men&#383;truums</i>, may ea&#383;ily per&#383;wade us, and what
  &#383;uch Vary'd Situations of Parts may do towards the Diver&#383;ifying
  of the manner of their Reflecting the Light, may <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61"></a>[pg 61]</span> be Gue&#383;s'd in
  &#383;ome Mea&#383;ure by the Beating of Tran&#383;parent Gla&#383;s into
  a White Powder, but farr better by the Experiments lately Pointed at, and
  hereafter Deliver'd, as the Producing and De&#383;troying Colours by the
  means of &#383;ubtil Saline Liquors, by who&#383;e Affu&#383;ion the
  Parts of other Liquors are manife&#383;tly both Agitated, and
  likewi&#383;e Di&#383;pos'd after another manner than they were before
  &#383;uch Affu&#383;ion. And in &#383;ome <i>Chymical</i> Oyls, as
  particularly that of Lemmon Pills, by barely Shaking the Gla&#383;s, that
  holds it, into Bubbles, that Tran&#383;po&#383;ition of the Parts which
  is con&#383;equent to the Shaking, will &#383;hew you on the Surfaces of
  the Bubbles exceeding Orient and Lively Colours, which when the Bubbles
  relap&#383;e into the re&#383;t of the Oyl, do immediately
  Vani&#383;h.</p>

  <p>24. I know not, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, whether I &#383;hould mention as a
  Di&#383;tinct way, becau&#383;e it is of a &#383;omewhat more General
  Nature, that Power, whereby a Liquor may alter the Colour of another
  Body, by putting the Parts of it into Motion; For though
  po&#383;&#383;ibly the Motion &#383;o produc'd, does, as &#383;uch,
  &#383;eldome &#383;uddenly change the Colour of the Body who&#383;e Parts
  are Agitated, yet this &#383;eems to be one of the mo&#383;t General,
  however not Immediate cau&#383;es of <!-- Page 62 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62"></a>[pg 62]</span> the Quick change of
  Colours in Bodies. For the Parts being put into Motion by the
  adventitious Liquor, divers of them that were before United, may become
  thereby Di&#383;joyn'd, and when that Motion cea&#383;es or decays others
  of them may &#383;tick together, and that in a new Order, by which means
  the Motion may &#383;ometimes produce Permanent changes of Colours, as in
  the Experiment you will meet with hereafter, of pre&#383;ently turning a
  Snowy White Body into a Yellow, by the bare Affu&#383;ion of fair Water,
  which probably &#383;o Di&#383;&#383;olves the Saline Corpu&#383;cles
  that remain'd in the <i>Calx</i>, and &#383;ets them at Liberty to Act
  upon one another, and the Metall, far more Powerfully than the Water
  without the A&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of &#383;uch Saline Corpu&#383;cles
  could do. And though you rubb Blew <i>Vitriol</i>, how Venereal and
  Un&#383;ophi&#383;ticated &#383;oever it be, upon the Whetted Blade of a
  Knife, it will not impart to the Iron its Latent Colour, but if you
  moi&#383;ten the <i>Vitriol</i> with your Spittle, or common Water, the
  Particles of the Liquor di&#383;joyning tho&#383;e of the <i>Vitriol</i>,
  and thereby giving them the Various Agitation requi&#383;ite to Fluid
  Bodies, the Metalline Corpu&#383;cles of the thus Di&#383;&#383;olv'd
  <i>Vitriol</i> will Lodge them&#383;elves in Throngs in the Small and
  Congruous <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63"></a>[pg
  63]</span> Pores of the Iron they are Rubb'd on, and &#383;o give the
  Surface of it the Genuine Colour of the Copper.</p>

  <p>25. There remains yet a way, <i>Pyrophilus</i> to be mention'd, by
  which a Liquor may alter the Colour of another Body, and this &#383;eems
  the mo&#383;t Important of all, becau&#383;e though it be nam'd but as
  One, yet it may indeed comprehend Many, and that is, by
  A&#383;&#383;ociating the Saline Corpu&#383;cles, or any other Sort of
  the more Rigid ones of the Liquor, with the Particles of the Body that it
  is employ'd to Work upon. For the&#383;e Adventitious Corpu&#383;cles
  A&#383;&#383;ociating them&#383;elves with the Protuberant Particles of
  the Surface of a Colour'd Body, mu&#383;t nece&#383;&#383;arily alter
  their Bigne&#383;s, and will mo&#383;t commonly alter their Shape. And
  how much the Colours of Bodies depend upon the Bulk and Figure of their
  Superficial Particles, you may Gue&#383;s by this, that eminent antient
  <i>Philo&#383;ophers</i> and divers <i>Moderns</i>, have thought that all
  Colours might in a general way be made out by the&#383;e two; who&#383;e
  being Diver&#383;ify'd, will in our Ca&#383;e be attended with the&#383;e
  two Circum&#383;tances, the One, that the Protuberant Particles being
  Increas'd in Bulk, they will oftentimes be Vary'd as to the
  Clo&#383;ne&#383;s or Laxity of <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_64"></a>[pg 64]</span> their Order, fewer of them being
  contain'd within the &#383;ame Sen&#383;ible (though Minute) &#383;pace
  than before; or el&#383;e by approaching to one another, they mu&#383;t
  Straighten the Pores, and it may be too, they will by their manner of
  A&#383;&#383;ociating them&#383;elves with the Protuberant Particles,
  intercept new Pores. And this invites me to con&#383;ider farther, that
  the Adventitious Corpu&#383;cles, I have been &#383;peaking of, may
  likewi&#383;e produce a great Change as well in the Little Cavities or
  Pores as in the Protuberances of a Colour'd Body; for be&#383;ides what
  we have ju&#383;t now taken notice of, they may by Lodging
  them&#383;elves in tho&#383;e little Cavities, fill them up, and it may
  well happen, that they may not only fill the Pores they In&#383;inuate
  them&#383;elves into, but likewi&#383;e have their Upper Parts extant
  above them; and partly by the&#383;e new Protuberances, partly by
  Increa&#383;ing the Bulk of the former, the&#383;e Extraneous
  Corpu&#383;cles may much alter the Number and Bigne&#383;s of the
  Surfaces Pores, changing the Old and Intercepting new ones. And then 'tis
  Odds, but the Order of the Little Extancies, and con&#383;equently that
  of the Little Depre&#383;&#383;ions in point of Situation will be alter'd
  likewi&#383;e: as if you di&#383;&#383;olve <i>Quick-&#383;ilver</i> in
  &#383;ome kind of <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, <!-- Page 65 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65"></a>[pg 65]</span> the Saline Particles
  of the <i>Menstruum</i> A&#383;&#383;ociating them&#383;elves with the
  Mercurial Corpu&#383;cles, will make a Green Solution, which afterwards
  ea&#383;ily enough Degenerates. And Red Lead or <i>Minium</i> being
  Di&#383;&#383;olv'd in Spirit of Vinegar, yields not a Red, but a Clear
  Solution, the Redne&#383;s of the Lead being by the Liquor
  De&#383;troy'd. But a better In&#383;tance may be taken from Copper, for
  I have try'd, that if upon a Copper-plate you let &#383;ome Drops of weak
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i> re&#383;t for a while, the Corpu&#383;cles of the
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, joyning with tho&#383;e of the Metall, will
  produce a very &#383;en&#383;ible A&#383;perity upon the Surface of the
  Plate, and will Concoagulate that way into very minute Grains of a Pale
  Blew <i>Vitriol</i>; whereas if upon another part of the &#383;ame Plate
  you &#383;uffer a little &#383;trong Spirit of Urine to re&#383;t a
  competent time, you &#383;hall find the A&#383;perated Surface adorn'd
  with a Deeper and Richer Blew. And the &#383;ame <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, that
  will quickly change the Redne&#383;s of Red Lead into a Darker Colour,
  will, being put upon Crude Lead, produce a Whiti&#383;h Sub&#383;tance,
  as with Copper it did a Blewi&#383;h. And as with Iron it will produce a
  Reddi&#383;h, and on White Quills a Yellowi&#383;h, &#383;o much may the
  Coalition of the Parts of the &#383;ame <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66"></a>[pg 66]</span> Liquor, with the
  differingly Figur'd Particles of Stable Bodies, divers ways A&#383;perate
  the differingly Di&#383;pos'd Surfaces, and to Diver&#383;ifie the Colour
  of tho&#383;e Bodies. And you'l ea&#383;ily believe, that in many changes
  of Colour, that happen upon the Di&#383;&#383;olutions of Metalls, and
  Precipitations made with Oyl of <i>Tartar</i>, and the like Fix'd Salts,
  there may Intervene a Coalition of Saline Corpu&#383;cles with the
  Particles of the Body Di&#383;&#383;olv'd or Precipitated, if you examine
  how much the <i>Vitriol</i> of a Metall may be Heavier than the Metalline
  part of it alone, upon the Score of the Saline parts Concoagulated
  therewith, and, that in Several Precipitations the weight of the
  <i>Calx</i> does for the &#383;ame Rea&#383;on much exceed that of the
  Metall, when it was fir&#383;t put in to be Di&#383;&#383;olv'd.</p>

  <p>26. But, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, to con&#383;ider the&#383;e Matters more
  particularly would be to forget that I declar'd again&#383;t Adventuring,
  at lea&#383;t for this time, at particular Theories of Colours, and that
  accordingly you may ju&#383;tly expect from me rather Experiments than
  Speculations, and therefore I &#383;hall Di&#383;mi&#383;s this Subject
  of the Forms of Superficial A&#383;perity in Colour'd Bodies, as
  &#383;oon as I &#383;hall but have nam'd to you by way of Supplement to
  what we have <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_67"></a>[pg 67]</span> hitherto Di&#383;cours'd in this
  Section, a Couple of Particulars, (which you'l ea&#383;ily grant me) The
  one, That there are divers other ways for the &#383;peedy Production even
  of True and Permanent Colours in Bodies, be&#383;ides tho&#383;e
  Practicable by the help of Liquors; for proof of which
  Adverti&#383;ement, though &#383;everal Examples might be alleged, yet I
  &#383;hall need but Re-mind you of what I mention'd to you above,
  touching the change of Colours &#383;uddenly made on Temper'd Steel, and
  on Lead, by the Operation of Heat, without the Intervention of a Liquor.
  But the other particular I am to ob&#383;erve to you is of more
  Importance to our pre&#383;ent Subject and it is, That though Nature and
  Art may in &#383;ome ca&#383;es &#383;o change the A&#383;perity of the
  Superficial parts of a Body, as to change its Colour by either of the
  ways I have propos'd Single or Una&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted, yet for the
  mo&#383;t part 'tis by two or three, or perhaps by more of the
  fore-mention'd ways A&#383;&#383;ociated together, that the Effect is
  produc'd, and if you con&#383;ider how Variou&#383;ly tho&#383;e
  &#383;everal ways and &#383;ome others Ally'd unto them, which I have
  left unmention'd, may be Compounded and Apply'd, you will not much wonder
  that &#383;uch fruitfull, whether Principles (or Manners of
  Diver&#383;ification) <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_68"></a>[pg 68]</span> &#383;hould be fitted to Change or
  Generate no &#383;mall &#383;tore of Differing Colours.</p>

  <p>27. Hitherto, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, we have in di&#383;cour&#383;ing of
  the A&#383;perity of Bodies con&#383;ider'd the little Protuberances of
  other Superficial particles which make up that Roughne&#383;s, as if we
  took it for granted, that they mu&#383;t be perfectly Opacous and
  Impenetrable by the Beams of Light, and &#383;o, mu&#383;t contribute to
  the Variety of Colours as they terminate more or le&#383;s Light, and
  reflect it to the Eye mix'd with more or le&#383;s of thus or thus
  mingl'd Shades. But to deal Ingenuou&#383;ly with you, <i>Pyrophilus</i>,
  before I proceed any further, I mu&#383;t not conceal from you, that I
  have often thought it worth a Serious Enquiry, whether or no Particles of
  Matter, each of them &#383;ing'y In&#383;en&#383;ible, and therefore
  &#383;mall enough to be capable of being &#383;uch Minute Particles as
  the <i>Atomi&#383;ts</i> both of old and of late have (not ab&#383;urdly)
  called <i>Corpu&#383;cula Coloris</i>, may not yet con&#383;i&#383;t each
  of them of divers yet Minuter Particles, betwixt which we may conceive
  little Commi&#383;&#383;ures where they Adhere to one another, and,
  however, may not be Porous enough to be, at lea&#383;t in &#383;ome
  degree, Pervious to the unimaginably &#383;ubtile Corpu&#383;cles that
  make up the Beams of <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_69"></a>[pg 69]</span> Light, and con&#383;equently to be in
  &#383;uch a degree Diaphanous. For, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, that the
  propo&#383;ed Enquiry may be of moment to him that &#383;earches after
  the Nature of Colour, you'l ea&#383;ily grant, if you con&#383;ider, that
  whereas Perfectly Opacous bodies can but reflect the incident Beams of
  Light, tho&#383;e that are Diaphanous are qualified to refract them too,
  and that Refraction has &#383;uch a &#383;troak in the Production of
  Colours, as you cannot but have taken notice of, and perhaps admir'd in
  the Colours generated by the Trajection of Light through Drops of Water
  that exhibit a Rain-bow, through Pri&#383;matical gla&#383;&#383;es, and
  through divers other Tran&#383;parent bodies. But 'tis like,
  <i>Pyrophilus</i>, you'l more ea&#383;ily allow that about this matter
  'tis rather Important to have a Certainty, than that 'tis Rational to
  entertain a Doubt; wherefore I mu&#383;t mention to you &#383;ome of the
  Rea&#383;ons that make me think it may need a further Enquiry, for I find
  that in a Darkned Room, where the Light is permitted to enter but at One
  hole, the little wandering Particles of Du&#383;t, that are commonly
  called Motes, and, unle&#383;s in the Sunbeams, are not taken notice of
  by the una&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted Sight, I have, I &#383;ay, often
  ob&#383;erv'd, that the&#383;e roving Corpu&#383;cles being look'd on by
  an Eye plac'd on one &#383;ide of the <!-- Page 70 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70"></a>[pg 70]</span> Beams that enter'd
  the Little hole, and by the Darkne&#383;s having its Pupill much
  Enlarg'd, I could di&#383;cern that the&#383;e Motes as &#383;oon as they
  came within the compa&#383;s of the Luminous, whether Cylinder or
  Inverted Cone, if I may &#383;o call it, that was made up by the
  Unclouded Beams of the Sun, did in certain po&#383;itions appear adorn'd
  with very vivid Colours, like tho&#383;e of the Rain-bow, or rather like
  tho&#383;e of very Minute, but Sparkling fragments of Diamonds; and as
  &#383;oon as the Continuance of their Motion had brought them to an
  Inconvenient po&#383;ition in reference to the Light and the Eye, they
  were only vi&#383;ible without Darting any lively Colours as before,
  which &#383;eems to argue that the&#383;e little Motes, or minute
  Fragments, of &#383;everal &#383;orts of bodies reputed Opacous, and only
  crumbled as to their Exteriour and Loo&#383;er parts into Du&#383;t, did
  not barely Reflect the Beams that fell upon them, but remit them to the
  Eye Refracted too. We may al&#383;o ob&#383;erve, that &#383;everal
  Bodies, (as well &#383;ome of a Vegetable, as others of an Animal nature)
  which are wont to pa&#383;s for Opacous, appear in great part
  Tran&#383;parent, when they are reduc'd into Thin parts, and held
  again&#383;t a powerful Light. This I have not only taken notice of in
  pieces of Ivory reduc'd but into Thick leaves, as al&#383;o in divers
  con&#383;iderable <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_71"></a>[pg 71]</span> Thick &#383;hells of Fi&#383;hes, and
  in &#383;having of Wood, but I have al&#383;o found that a piece of Deal,
  far thicker than one would ea&#383;ily imagine, being purpo&#383;ly
  interpo&#383;ed betwixt my Eye plac'd in a Room, and the clear Daylight,
  was not only &#383;omewhat Tran&#383;parent, but (perhaps by rea&#383;on
  of its Gummous nature) appear'd quite through of a lovely Red. And in the
  Darkned Room above mention'd, Bodies held again&#383;t the hole at which
  the Light enter'd, appear'd far le&#383;s Opacous then they would
  el&#383;ewhere have done, in&#383;omuch that I could ea&#383;ily and
  plainly &#383;ee through the whole Thickne&#383;s of my Hand, the Motions
  of a Body plac'd (at a very near di&#383;tance indeed, but yet) beyond
  it. And even in Minerals, the Opacity is not always &#383;o great as many
  think, if the Body be made Thin, for White Marble though of a pretty
  Thickne&#383;s, being within a Due di&#383;tance plac'd betwixt the Eye
  and a Convenient Light, will Suffer the Motions of ones Finger to be well
  di&#383;cern'd through it, and &#383;o will pieces, Thick enough, of many
  common Flints. But above all, that In&#383;tance is remarkable, that is
  afforded us by <i>Mu&#383;covie</i> gla&#383;s, (which &#383;ome call
  <i>Selenites</i>, others <i>Lapis Specularis</i>) for though plates of
  this Mineral, though but of a moderate Thickne&#383;s, do often appear
  Opacous, yet if <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_72"></a>[pg 72]</span> one of the&#383;e be Dextrou&#383;ly
  &#383;plit into the thinne&#383;t Leaves 'tis made up of, it will yield
  &#383;uch a number of them, as &#383;carce any thing but Experience could
  have per&#383;waded me, and the&#383;e Leaves will afford the mo&#383;t
  Tran&#383;parent &#383;ort of con&#383;i&#383;tent Bodies, that, for
  ought I have ob&#383;erv'd, are yet known; and a &#383;ingle Leaf or
  Plate will be &#383;o far from being Opacous, that 'twill &#383;carce be
  &#383;o much as Vi&#383;ible. And multitudes of Bodies there are,
  who&#383;e Fragments &#383;eem Opacous to the naked Eye, which yet, when
  I have included them in good <i>Micro&#383;copes</i>, appear'd
  Tran&#383;parent; but, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, on the other &#383;ide I am not
  yet &#383;ure that there are no Bodies, who&#383;e Minute Particles even
  in &#383;uch a <i>Micro&#383;cope</i> as that of mine, which I was lately
  mentioning, will not appear Diaphanous. For having con&#383;ider'd
  <i>Mercury</i> Precipitated <i>per &#383;e</i>, the little Granules that
  made up the powder, look'd like little fragments of Coral beheld by the
  naked Eye at a Di&#383;tance (for very Near at hand Coral will
  &#383;ometimes, e&#383;pecially if it be Good, &#383;hew &#383;ome
  Tran&#383;parency.) Filings likewi&#383;e of Steel and Copper, though in
  an excellent <i>Micro&#383;cope</i>, and a fair Day, they &#383;how'd
  like pretty Big Fragments of tho&#383;e Metalls, and had
  con&#383;iderable Brightne&#383;s on &#383;ome of their Surfaces, yet I
  was not &#383;atisfi'd, that I perceiv'd <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73"></a>[pg 73]</span> any Reflection from
  the Inner parts of any of the Filings. Nay, having look'd in my be&#383;t
  <i>Micro&#383;cope</i> upon the Red <i>Calx</i> of Lead, (commonly call'd
  <i>Minium</i>) neither I, nor any I &#383;hew'd it to, could di&#383;cern
  it to be other than Opacous, though the Day were Clear, and the Object
  &#383;trongly Enlightned. And the deeply Red Colour of <i>Vitriol</i>
  appear'd in the &#383;ame <i>Micro&#383;cope</i> (notwith&#383;tanding
  the great Comminution effected by the Fire) but like Gro&#383;&#383;y
  beaten Brick. So that, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, I &#383;hall willingly
  re&#383;ign you the care of making &#383;ome further Enquiries into the
  Subject we have now been con&#383;idering; for I confe&#383;s, as I told
  you before, that I think that the Matter may need a further Scrutiny, nor
  would I be forward to Determine how far or in what ca&#383;es the
  Tran&#383;parency or Semi-diaphaniety of the Superficial Corpu&#383;cles
  of Bigger Bodies, may have an Intere&#383;t in the Production of their
  Colours, e&#383;pecially becau&#383;e that even in divers White bodies,
  as Beaten Gla&#383;s, Snow and Froth, where it &#383;eems manife&#383;t
  that the Superficial parts are &#383;ingly Diaphanous, (being either
  Water, or Air, or Gla&#383;s) we &#383;ee not that &#383;uch Variety of
  Colours are produc'd as u&#383;ually are by the Refraction of Light, even
  in tho&#383;e Bodies, when by their Bigne&#383;s, Shape, &amp;c. they are
  conveniently <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_74"></a>[pg 74]</span> qualify'd to exhibit &#383;uch Various
  and Lively Colours as tho&#383;e of the Rain-bow, and of Pri&#383;matical
  Gla&#383;&#383;es.</p>

  <p>28. By what has been hitherto di&#383;cours'd, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, we
  may be a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted to judge of that famous Controver&#383;ie
  which was of Old di&#383;puted betwixt the <i>Epicureans</i> and other
  <i>Atomi&#383;ts</i> on the one &#383;ide, and mo&#383;t other
  <i>Philo&#383;ophers</i> on the other &#383;ide. The former Denying
  Bodies to be Colour'd in the Dark, and the Latter making Colour to be an
  Inherent quality, as well as Figure, Hardne&#383;s; Weight, or the like.
  For though this Controver&#383;ie be Reviv'd, and hotly Agitated among
  the <i>Moderns</i>, yet I doubt whether it be not in great part a Nominal
  di&#383;pute, and therefore let us, according to the Doctrine formerly
  deliver'd, Di&#383;tingui&#383;h the Acceptions of the word Colour, and
  &#383;ay, that if it be taken in the Stricter Sen&#383;e, the
  <i>Epicureans</i> &#383;eem to be in the Right, for if Colour be indeed,
  though not according to them, but Light Modify'd, how can we conceive
  that it can Sub&#383;i&#383;t in the Dark, that is, where it mu&#383;t be
  &#383;uppos'd there is no Light; but on the other &#383;ide, if Colour be
  con&#383;ider'd as a certain Con&#383;tant Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the
  Superficial parts of the Object to Trouble the Light they Reflect after
  &#383;uch and &#383;uch a Determinate manner, <!-- Page 75 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75"></a>[pg 75]</span> this Con&#383;tant,
  and, if I may &#383;o &#383;peak, Modifying di&#383;po&#383;ition
  per&#383;evering in the Object, whether it be Shin'd upon or no, there
  &#383;eems no ju&#383;t rea&#383;on to deny, but that in this Sen&#383;e,
  Bodies retain their Colour as well in the Night as Day; or, to Speak a
  little otherwi&#383;e, it may be &#383;aid, that Bodies are Potentially
  Colour'd in the Dark, and Actually in the Light. But of this Matter
  di&#383;cour&#383;ing more fully el&#383;ewhere, as 'tis a difficulty
  that concerns Qualities in general, I &#383;hall forbear to
  in&#383;i&#383;t on it here.</p>

<h3>CHAP. IV</h3>

  <p>1. Of greater Moment in the Inve&#383;tigation of the Nature of
  Colours is the Controver&#383;ie, Whether tho&#383;e of the Rain-bow, and
  tho&#383;e that are often &#383;een in Clouds, before the Ri&#383;ing, or
  after the Setting of the Sun; and in a word, Whether tho&#383;e other
  Colours, that are wont to be call'd Emphatical, ought or ought not to be
  accounted True Colours. I need not tell you that the Negative is the
  Common Opinion, e&#383;pecially in the Schools, as may appear by that
  Vulgar di&#383;tinction of Colours, whereby the&#383;e under
  Con&#383;ideration are term'd Apparent, by way of Oppo&#383;ition <!--
  Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76"></a>[pg 76]</span> to
  tho&#383;e that in the other Member of the Di&#383;tinction are call'd
  True or Genuine. This que&#383;tion I &#383;ay &#383;eems to me of
  Importance, upon this Account, that it being commonly Granted, (or
  however, ea&#383;ie enough to be Prov'd) that Emphatical Colours are
  Light it &#383;elf Modify'd by Refractions chiefly, with a concurrence
  &#383;ometimes of Reflections, and perhaps &#383;ome other Accidents
  depending on the&#383;e two; if the&#383;e Emphatical Colours be
  re&#383;olv'd to be Genuine, it will &#383;eem con&#383;equent, that
  Colours, or at lea&#383;t divers of them, are but Diver&#383;ify'd Light,
  and not &#383;uch Real and Inherent qualities as they are commonly
  thought to be.</p>

  <p>2. Now &#383;ince we are wont to e&#383;teem the Echoes and other
  Sounds of Bodies, to be True Sounds, all their Odours to be True Odours,
  and (to be &#383;hort) &#383;ince we judge other Sen&#383;ible Qualities
  to be True ones, becau&#383;e they are the proper Objects of &#383;ome or
  other of our Sen&#383;es, I &#383;ee not why Emphatical Colours, being
  the proper and peculiar Objects of the Organ of Sight, and capable to
  Affect it as Truly and as Powerfully as other Colours, &#383;hould be
  reputed but Imaginary ones.</p>

  <p>And if we have (which perchance you'l allow) formerly evinc'd Colour,
  (when <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77"></a>[pg
  77]</span> the word is taken in its more Proper &#383;en&#383;e) to be
  but Modify'd Light, there will be &#383;mall Rea&#383;on to deny
  the&#383;e to be true Colours, which more manife&#383;tly than others
  di&#383;clo&#383;e them&#383;elves to be produc'd by
  Diver&#383;ifications of the Light.</p>

  <p>3. There is indeed taken notice of a Difference betwixt the&#383;e
  Apparent colours, and tho&#383;e that are wont to be e&#383;teem'd
  Genuine, as to the Duration, which has induc'd &#383;ome Learned Men to
  call the former rather Evanid than Fanta&#383;tical. But as the Ingenious
  <i>Ga&#383;&#383;endus</i> does &#383;omewhere Judiciou&#383;ly
  ob&#383;erve, if this way of Arguing were Good, the Greene&#383;s of a
  Leaf ought to pa&#383;s for Apparent, becau&#383;e, &#383;oon Fading into
  a Yellow, it Scarce la&#383;ts at all, in compari&#383;on of the
  Greene&#383;s of an Emerauld. I &#383;hall add, that if the Sun-beams be
  in a convenient manner trajected through a Gla&#383;s-pri&#383;m, and
  thrown upon &#383;ome well-&#383;haded Object within a Room, the Rain-bow
  thereby Painted on the Surface of the Body that Terminates the Beams, may
  oftentimes la&#383;t longer than Some Colours I have produc'd in certain
  Bodies, which would ju&#383;tly, and without &#383;cruple be accounted
  Genuine Colours, and yet &#383;uddenly Degenerate, and lo&#383;e their
  Nature.</p>

  <p>4. A greater Di&#383;parity betwixt Emphatical <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78"></a>[pg 78]</span> Colours, and others,
  may perhaps be taken from this, that Genuine Colours &#383;eem to be
  produc'd in Opacous Bodies by Reflection, but Apparent ones in Diaphanous
  Bodies, and principally by Refraction, I &#383;ay Principally rather than
  Solely, becau&#383;e in &#383;ome ca&#383;es Reflection al&#383;o may
  concurr, but &#383;till this &#383;eems not to conclude the&#383;e Latter
  Colours not to be True ones. Nor mu&#383;t what has been newly &#383;aid
  of the Differences of True and Apparent Colours, be interpreted in too
  Unlimited a Sen&#383;e, and therefore it may perhaps &#383;omewhat
  A&#383;&#383;i&#383;t you, both to Reflect upon the two fore-going
  Objections, and to judge of &#383;ome other Pa&#383;&#383;ages which
  you'l meet with in this Tract, if I take this Occa&#383;ion to
  ob&#383;erve to you, that if Water be Agitated into Froth, it exhibits
  you know a White colour, which &#383;oon after it Lo&#383;es upon the
  Re&#383;olution of the Bubbles into Air and Water, now in this ca&#383;e
  either the Whitene&#383;s of the Froth is a True Colour or not, if it be,
  then True Colours, &#383;uppo&#383;ing the Water pure and free from
  Mixtures of any thing Tenacious, may be as Short-liv'd as tho&#383;e of
  the Rain-bow; al&#383;o the Matter, wherein the Whitene&#383;s did
  Re&#383;ide, may in a few moments perfectly Lo&#383;e all foot-&#383;teps
  or remains of it. And <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_79"></a>[pg 79]</span> be&#383;ides, even Diaphanous Bodies
  may be capable of exhibiting True Colours by Reflection, for that
  Whitene&#383;s is &#383;o produc'd, we &#383;hall anon make it probable.
  But if on the other &#383;ide it be &#383;aid, that the Whitene&#383;s of
  Froth is an Emphatical Colour, then it mu&#383;t no longer be &#383;aid,
  that Fanta&#383;tical Colours require a certain Po&#383;ition of the
  Luminary and the Eye, and mu&#383;t be Vary'd or De&#383;troy'd by the
  Change thereof, &#383;ince Froth appears White, whether the Sun be
  Ri&#383;ing or Setting, or in the Meridian, or any where between it and
  the Horizon, and from what (Neighbouring) place &#383;oever the Beholders
  Eye looks upon it. And &#383;ince by making a Liquor Tenacious enough,
  yet without De&#383;troying its Tran&#383;parency, or Staining it with
  any Colour, you may give the Little Films, whereof the Bubbles
  con&#383;i&#383;t, &#383;uch a Texture, as may make the Froth la&#383;t
  very many Hours, if not &#383;ome Days, or even Weeks, it will render it
  &#383;omewhat Improper to a&#383;&#383;ign Duration for the
  Di&#383;tingui&#383;hing Character to Di&#383;criminate Genuine from
  Fanta&#383;tical Colours. For &#383;uch Froth may much outla&#383;t the
  Undoubtedly true Colours of &#383;ome of Nature's Productions, as in that
  Gaudy Plant not unde&#383;ervedly call'd the Mervail of <i>Peru</i>, the
  Flowers do often Fade, the <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_80"></a>[pg 80]</span> &#383;ame Day they are Blown; And I
  have often &#383;een a <i>Virginian</i> Flower, which u&#383;ually
  Withers within the compa&#383;s of a Day; and I am credibly Inform'd,
  that not far from hence a curious Herbori&#383;t has a Plant, who&#383;e
  Flowers peri&#383;h in about an Hour. But if the Whitene&#383;s of Water
  turn'd into Froth mu&#383;t therefore be reputed Emphatical, becau&#383;e
  it appears not that the Nature of the Body is Alter'd, but only that the
  Di&#383;po&#383;ition of its Parts in reference to the Incident Light is
  Chang'd, why may not the Whitene&#383;s be accounted Emphatical too,
  which I &#383;hall &#383;hew anon to be Producible, barely by &#383;uch
  another change in Black Horn? and yet this &#383;o ea&#383;ily acquir'd
  Whitene&#383;s &#383;eems to be as truly its Colour as the Blackne&#383;s
  was before, and at lea&#383;t is more Permanent than the Greenne&#383;s
  of Leaves, the Redne&#383;s of Ro&#383;es, and, in &#383;hort, than the
  Genuine Colours of the mo&#383;t part of Nature's Productions. It may
  indeed be further Objected, that according as the Sun or other Luminous
  Body changes place, the&#383;e Emphatical Colours alter or vani&#383;h.
  But not to repeat what I have ju&#383;t now &#383;aid, I &#383;hall add,
  that if a piece of Cloath in a Drapers Shop (in &#383;uch the Light being
  &#383;eldome Primary) be variou&#383;ly Folded, it will appear of
  differing <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81"></a>[pg
  81]</span> Colours, as the Parts happen to be more Illuminated or more
  Shaded, and if you &#383;tretch it Flat, it will commonly exhibit
  &#383;ome one Uniform Colour, and yet the&#383;e are not wont to be
  reputed Emphatical, &#383;o that the Difference &#383;eems to be chiefly
  this, that in the Ca&#383;e of the Rain-bow, and the like, the
  Po&#383;ition of the Luminary Varies the Colour, and in the Cloath I have
  been mentioning, the Po&#383;ition of the Object does it. Nor am I
  forward to allow that in all Ca&#383;es the Apparition of Emphatical
  Colours requires a Determinate po&#383;ition of the Eye, for if Men will
  have the Whitene&#383;s of Froth Emphatical, you know what we have
  already Inferr'd from thence. Be&#383;ides, the Sun-beams trajected
  through a Triangular Gla&#383;s, after the manner lately mention'd, will,
  upon the Body that Terminates them, Paint a Rain-bow, that may be
  &#383;een whether the Eye be plac'd on the Right Hand of it or the Left,
  or Above or Beneath it, or Before or Behind it; and though there may
  appear &#383;ome Little Variation in the Colours of the Rain-bow, beheld
  from Differing parts of the Room, yet &#383;uch a Diver&#383;ity may be
  al&#383;o ob&#383;erv'd by an Attentive Eye in Real Colours, look'd upon
  under the like Circum&#383;tances, Nor will it follow, <!-- Page 82
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82"></a>[pg 82]</span> that
  becau&#383;e there remains no Foot&#383;teps of the Colour upon the
  Object, when the Pri&#383;m is Remov'd, that therefore the Colour was not
  Real, &#383;ince the Light was truly Modify'd by the Refraction and
  Reflection it Suffer'd in its Trajection through the Pri&#383;m; and the
  Object in our ca&#383;e &#383;erv'd for a Specular Body, to Reflect that
  Colour to the Eye. And that you may not be Startled, <i>Pyrophilus</i>,
  that I &#383;hould Venture to &#383;ay, that a Rough and Coiour'd Object
  may &#383;erve for a <i>Speculum</i> to Reflect the Artificial Rain-bow I
  have been mentioning, con&#383;ider what u&#383;ually happens in Darkned
  Rooms, where a Wall, or other Body conveniently Situated within, may
  &#383;o Reflect the Colours of Bodies, without the Room, that they may
  very clearly be Di&#383;cern'd and Di&#383;tingui&#383;h'd, and yet 'tis
  taken for granted, that the Colours &#383;een in a Darkned Room, though
  they leave no Traces of them&#383;elves upon the Wall or Body that
  Receives them, are the True Colours of the External Objects, together
  with which the Colours of the Images are Mov'd or do Re&#383;t. And the
  Errour is not in the Eye, who&#383;e Office is only to perceive the
  Appearances of things, and which does Truly &#383;o, but in the Judging
  or E&#383;timative faculty, which Mi&#383;takingly <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83"></a>[pg 83]</span> concludes that
  Colour to belong to the Wall, which does indeed belong to the Object,
  becau&#383;e the Wall is that from whence the Beams of Light that carry
  the Vi&#383;ible <i>Species</i>, do come in Straight Lines directly to
  the Eye, as for the &#383;ame Rea&#383;on we are wont at a certain
  Di&#383;tance from Concave Sphærical Gla&#383;&#383;es, to per&#383;wade
  our Selves that we &#383;ee the Image come forth to Meet us, and Hang in
  the Air betwixt the Gla&#383;s and Us, becau&#383;e the Reflected Beams
  that Compo&#383;e the image cro&#383;s in that place, where the Image
  &#383;eems to be, and thence, and not from the Gla&#383;s, do in Direct
  Lines take their Cour&#383;e to the Eye, and upon the like Cau&#383;e it
  is, that divers Deceptions in Sounds and other Sen&#383;ible Objects do
  depend, as we el&#383;ewhere declare.</p>

  <p>5. I know not, whether I need add, that I have purpo&#383;ely Try'd,
  (as you'l find &#383;ome Pages hence, and will perhaps think
  &#383;omewhat &#383;trange) that Colours that are call'd Emphatical,
  becau&#383;e not Inherent in, the Bodies in which they Appear, may be
  Compounded with one another, as tho&#383;e that are confe&#383;&#383;edly
  Genuine may. But when all this is &#383;aid, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, I
  mu&#383;t Adverti&#383;e you, that it is but Problematically Spoken, and
  that though I think the Opinion <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_84"></a>[pg 84]</span> I have endeavour'd to fortifie
  Probable, yet a great part of our Di&#383;cour&#383;e concerning Colours
  may be True, whether that Opinion be &#383;o or not.</p>

<h3>CHAP. V.</h3>

  <p>1. There are you know, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, be&#383;ides tho&#383;e
  Ob&#383;olete Opinions about Colours which have been long &#383;ince
  Rejected, very Various Theories that have each of them, even at this day,
  Eminent Men for its Abetters; for the Peripatetick Schools, though they
  di&#383;pute among&#383;t them&#383;elves divers particulars concerning
  Colours, yet in this they &#383;eem Unanimou&#383;ly enough to Agree,
  that Colours are Inherent and Real Qualities, which the Light doth but
  Di&#383;clo&#383;e, and not concurr to Produce. Be&#383;ides there are
  <i>Moderns</i>, who with a &#383;light Variation adopt the Opinion of
  <i>Plato</i>, and as he would have Colour to be nothing but a Kind of
  Flame con&#383;i&#383;ting of Minute Corpu&#383;cles as it were Darted by
  the Object again&#383;t the Eye, to who&#383;e Pores their
  Littlene&#383;s and Figure made them congruous, &#383;o the&#383;e would
  have Colour to be an Internal Light of the more Lucid parts of the
  Object, Darkned and con&#383;equently Alter'd by the Various Mixtures of
  the le&#383;s Luminous <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_85"></a>[pg 85]</span> parts. There are al&#383;o others, who
  in imitation of &#383;ome of the Ancient <i>Atomi&#383;ts</i>, make
  Colour not to be Lucid &#383;team, but yet a Corporeal <i>Effluvium</i>
  i&#383;&#383;uing out of the Colour'd Body, but the Knowing&#383;t of
  the&#383;e have of late Reform'd their Hypothe&#383;is, by acknowledging
  and adding that &#383;ome External Light is nece&#383;&#383;ary to
  Excite, and as <i>they</i> &#383;peak, Sollicit the&#383;e
  Corpu&#383;cles of Colour as <i>they</i> call them, and Bring them to the
  Eye. Another and more principal Opinion of the <i>Modern</i>
  Philo&#383;ophers, to which this la&#383;t nam'd may by a Favourable
  explication be reconcil'd, is that which derives Colours from the Mixture
  of Light and Darkne&#383;s, or rather Light and Shadows. And as for the
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> 'tis known, that the generality of them
  a&#383;cribes the Origine of Colours to the Sulphureous Principle in
  Bodies, though I find, as I el&#383;ewhere largely &#383;hew, that
  &#383;ome of the Chiefe&#383;t of them derive Colours rather from Salt
  than Sulphur, and others, from the third Hypo&#383;tatical Principle,
  <i>Mercury</i>. And as for the <i>Carte&#383;ians</i> I need not tell
  you, that they, &#383;uppo&#383;ing the Sen&#383;ation of Light to bee
  produc'd by the Impul&#383;e made upon the Organs of Sight, by certain
  extremely Minute and Solid Globules, to which the Pores of the Air and
  other Diaphanous <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_86"></a>[pg 86]</span> bodies are pervious, endeavour to
  derive the Varieties of Colours from the Various Proportion of the Direct
  Progre&#383;s or Motion of the&#383;e Globules to their Circumvolution or
  Motion about their own Centre, by which Varying Proportion they are by
  this Hypothe&#383;is &#383;uppos'd qualify'd to &#383;trike the Optick
  Nerve after &#383;everal Di&#383;tinct manners, &#383;o to produce the
  perception of Differing Colours.</p>

  <p>2. Be&#383;ides the&#383;e &#383;ix principal Hypothe&#383;es,
  <i>Pyrophilus</i>, there may be &#383;ome others, which though Le&#383;s
  known, may perhaps as well as the&#383;c de&#383;erve to be taken into
  con&#383;ideration by you; but that I &#383;hould copiou&#383;ly debate
  any of them at pre&#383;ent, I pre&#383;ume you will not expect, if you
  con&#383;ider the Scope of the&#383;e Papers, and the Brevity I have
  de&#383;ign'd in them, and therefore I &#383;hall at this time only take
  notice to you in the general of two or three things that do more
  peculiarly concern the Treati&#383;e you have now in your hands.</p>

  <p>3. And fir&#383;t, though the Embracers of the Several Hypothe&#383;es
  I have been naming to you, by undertaking each Sect of them to explicate
  Colours indefinitely, by the particular Hypothe&#383;es they maintain,
  &#383;eem to hold it forth as the only Needful Theory about that Subject,
  yet for my part I doubt <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_87"></a>[pg 87]</span> whether any one of all the&#383;e
  Hypothe&#383;es have a right to be admitted Exclu&#383;ively to all
  others, for I think it Probable, that Whitene&#383;s and Blackne&#383;s
  may be explicated by Reflection alone without Refraction, as you'l find
  endeavour'd in the Di&#383;cour&#383;e you'l meet with e're long Of the
  Origine of Whitene&#383;s and Blackne&#383;s, and on the other &#383;ide,
  &#383;ince I have not found that by any Mixture of White and True Black,
  (for there is a Blewi&#383;h Black which many mi&#383;take for a Genuine)
  there can be a Blew, a Yellow, or a Red, to name no other Colours,
  produced, and &#383;ince we do find that the&#383;e Colours may be
  produc'd in the Gla&#383;s-pri&#383;m and other Tran&#383;parent bodies,
  by the help of Refractions, it &#383;eems that Refraction is to be taken
  in into the Explication of &#383;ome Colours, to who&#383;e Generation
  they &#383;eem to concurr, either by making a further or other Commixture
  of Shades with the Refracted Light, or by &#383;ome other way not now to
  be di&#383;cours'd. And as it &#383;eems not improbable, that in
  ca&#383;e the Pores of the Air, and other Diaphanous bodies be every
  where almo&#383;t fill'd with &#383;uch <i>Globuli</i> as the
  <i>Carte&#383;ians</i> &#383;uppo&#383;e, the Various kind of Motion of
  the&#383;e <i>Globuli</i>, may in many ca&#383;es have no &#383;mall
  &#383;troak in Varying our Perception of Colour, &#383;o <!-- Page 88
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88"></a>[pg 88]</span> without the
  Suppo&#383;ition of the&#383;e <i>Globuli</i>, which 'tis not &#383;o
  ea&#383;ie to evince, I think we may probably enough conceive in general,
  that the Eye may be Variou&#383;ly affected, not only by the Entire Beams
  of Light that fall upon it as they are &#383;uch, but by the Order, and
  by the Degree of Swiftne&#383;s, and in a word by the Manner according to
  which the Particles that compo&#383;e each Particular Beam arrive at the
  Sen&#383;ory, &#383;o that whatever be the Figure of the Little
  Corpu&#383;cles, of which the Beams of Light con&#383;i&#383;t, not only
  the Celerity or Slowne&#383;s of their Revolution or Rotation in
  reference to their Progre&#383;&#383;ive Motion, but their more
  Ab&#383;olute Celerity, their Direct or Undulating Motion, and other
  Accidents, which may attend their Appul&#383;e to the Eye, may fit them
  to make Differing Impre&#383;&#383;ions on it.</p>

  <p>4. Secondly, For the&#383;e and the like Con&#383;iderations,
  <i>Pyrophilus</i>, I mu&#383;t de&#383;ire that you would look upon this
  little Treati&#383;e, not as a Di&#383;cour&#383;e written Principally to
  maintain any of the fore-mention'd Theories, Exclu&#383;ively to all
  others, or &#383;ub&#383;titute a New one of my Own, but as the beginning
  of a Hi&#383;tory of Colours, upon which, when you and your Ingenious
  friends &#383;hall have Enrich'd it, a Solid Theory may be <!-- Page 89
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89"></a>[pg 89]</span> &#383;afely
  built. But yet becau&#383;e this Hi&#383;tory is not meant barely for a
  Regi&#383;ter of the things recorded in it, but for an <i>Apparatus</i>
  to a &#383;ound and comprehen&#383;itive Hypothe&#383;is, I thought fit,
  &#383;o to temper the whole Di&#383;cour&#383;e, as to make it as
  conducible, as conveniently I can to that End, and therefore I have not
  &#383;crupled to let you &#383;ee that I was willing, as to &#383;ave you
  the labour of Cultivating &#383;ome Theories that I thought would never
  enable you to reach the Ends you aim at, &#383;o to contract your
  Enquiries into a Narrow compa&#383;s, for both which purpo&#383;es I
  thought it requi&#383;ite to do the&#383;e two things, the <i>One</i>, to
  &#383;et down &#383;ome Experiments which by the help of the Reflections
  and In&#383;inuations that attend them, may a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t you to
  di&#383;cover the Infirmne&#383;s and In&#383;ufficiency both of the
  common Peripatetick Doctrine, and of the now more applauded Theory of the
  <i>Chymists</i> about Colour, becau&#383;e tho&#383;e two Doctrines
  having Po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s'd them&#383;elves, the one of the mo&#383;t
  part of the Schools, and the other of the E&#383;teem of the Generality
  ef Phy&#383;icians and other Learned Men, who&#383;e
  Profe&#383;&#383;ions and Ways of Study do not exact that they
  &#383;hould Scrupulou&#383;ly examine the very Fir&#383;t and
  Simple&#383;t Principles of Nature, I fear'd it would be to <!-- Page 90
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90"></a>[pg 90]</span> little
  purpo&#383;e, without doing &#383;omething to di&#383;cover the
  In&#383;ufficiency of the&#383;e Hypothe&#383;es, that I &#383;hould,
  (which was the <i>Other</i> thing I thought requi&#383;ite for me to do)
  &#383;et down among my other Experiments tho&#383;e in the greate&#383;t
  Number, that may let you &#383;ee, that, till I &#383;hall be Better
  Inform'd, I encline to take Colour to be a Modification of Light, and
  would invite you chiefly to Cultivate that Hypothe&#383;is, and Improve
  it to the making out of the Generation of Particular Colours, as I have
  Endeavour'd to apply it to the Explication of Whitene&#383;s and
  Blackne&#383;s.</p>

  <p>5. Thirdly. But, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, though this be at pre&#383;ent the
  Hypothe&#383;is I preferr, yet I propo&#383;e it but in a General
  Sen&#383;e, teaching only that the Beams of Light, Modify'd by the Bodies
  whence they are &#383;ent (Reflected or Refracted) to the Eye, produce
  there that Kind of Sen&#383;ation, Men commonly call Colour; But whether
  I think this Modification of the Light to be perform'd by Mixing it with
  Shades, or by Varying the Proportion of the Progre&#383;s and Rotation of
  the <i>Carte&#383;ian Globuli Cæle&#383;tes</i>, or by &#383;ome other
  way which I am not now to mention, I pretend not here to Declare. Much
  le&#383;s do I pretend to Determine, or &#383;carce &#383;o much as to
  Hope to <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91"></a>[pg
  91]</span> know all that were requi&#383;ite to be Known, to give You, or
  even my Self, a perfect account of the Theory of Vi&#383;ion and Colours,
  for in Order to &#383;uch an undertaking I would fir&#383;t Know what
  Light is, and if it be a Body (as a Body or the Motion of a Body it
  &#383;eems to be) what Kind of Corpu&#383;cles for Size and Shape it
  con&#383;i&#383;ts of, with what Swiftne&#383;s they move Forwards, and
  Whirl about their own Centres. Then I would Know the Nature of
  Refraction, which I take to be one of the Ab&#383;tru&#383;e&#383;t
  things (not to explicate Plau&#383;ibly, but to explicate Satisfactorily)
  that I have met with in Phy&#383;icks; I would further Know what Kind and
  what Degree of Commixture of Darkne&#383;s or Shades is made by
  Refractions or Reflections, or both, in the Superficial particles of
  tho&#383;e Bodies, that being Shin'd upon, con&#383;tantly exhibit the
  one, for In&#383;tance, a Blew, the other a Yellow, the third a Red
  Colour; I would further Know why this Contemperation of Light and Shade,
  that is made, for Example, by the Skin of a Ripe Cherry, &#383;hould
  exhibit a Red, and not a Green, and the Leaf of the &#383;ame Tree
  &#383;hould exhibit a Green rather than a Red; and indeed, La&#383;tly,
  why &#383;ince the Light that is Modify'd into the&#383;e Colours
  con&#383;i&#383;ts but of Corpu&#383;cles <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92"></a>[pg 92]</span> moved again&#383;t
  the <i>Retina</i> or Pith of the Optick Nerve, it &#383;hould there not
  barely give a Stroak, but produce a Colour, whereas a Needle wounding
  likewi&#383;e the Eye, would not produce Colour but Pain. The&#383;e, and
  perhaps other things I &#383;hould think requi&#383;ite to be Known,
  before I &#383;hould judge my Self to have fully Comprehended the True
  and Whole Nature of Colours; and therefore, though by making the
  Experiments and Reflections deliver'd in this Paper, I have endeavour'd
  &#383;omewhat to Le&#383;&#383;en my Ignorance in this Matter, and think
  it far more De&#383;ireable to di&#383;cover a Little, than to
  di&#383;cover Nothing, yet I pretend but to make it Probable by the
  Experiments I mention, that &#383;ome Colours may be Plau&#383;ibly
  enough Explicated in the General by the Doctrine here propos'd; For
  when&#383;oever I would De&#383;cend to the Minute and Accurate
  Explication of Particulars, I find my Self very Sen&#383;ible of the
  great Ob&#383;curity of things, without excepting tho&#383;e which we

  Ab&#383;tru&#383;e Nature of Colours in <i>particular</i>, you will
  ea&#383;ily believe, that I pretend not to give you a Satisfactory

  <p>2. When I apply'd my Self to con&#383;ider, how the cau&#383;e of
  Whitene&#383;s might be explan'd by Intelligible and Mechanical
  Principles, I remembred not to have met with any thing among the Antient
  <i>Corpu&#383;cularian</i> Philo&#383;ophers, touching the Quality we
  call Whitene&#383;s, &#383;ave that <i>Democritus</i> is by
  <i>Ari&#383;totle</i> &#383;aid to have a&#383;crib'd the Whitene&#383;s
  of Bodies to their Smoothne&#383;s, and on the contrary their
  Blackne&#383;s to their A&#383;perity.<a name="NtA_6"></a><a

  Qualities his Opinion be allowable, as we &#383;hall &#383;ee anon, yet
  that he heeds a Favourable Interpretation in what is Deliver'd concerning

  <p>3. But though in this pa&#383;&#383;age, that very Ingenous
  Per&#383;on has Anticipated part of what I &#383;hould &#383;ay; Yet I
  pre&#383;ume you will for all that expect, that I &#383;hould give you a
  fuller Account of that Notion of Whitene&#383;s, which I have the
  lea&#383;t Exceptions to, and of the Particulars whence I deduce it,
  which to do, I mu&#383;t mention to you the following Experiments and
  Ob&#383;ervations.</p>

  <p>Whitene&#383;s then con&#383;ider'd as a Quality in the Object,
  &#383;eems chiefly to depend upon this, That the Superficies of the Body
  that is call'd White, is A&#383;perated by almo&#383;t innumerable Small
  Surfaces, which being of an almo&#383;t Specular Nature, are al&#383;o
  &#383;o Plac'd, that &#383;ome Looking this way, and &#383;ome that way,
  they yet Reflect the Rays of Light that fall on them, not towards one
  another, but outwards towards the Spectators Eye. In this Rude and
  General account of Whitene&#383;s, it &#383;eems that be&#383;ides
  tho&#383;e Qualities, which are common to Bodies of other Colours, as for
  in&#383;tance the Minutene&#383;s and Number of the Superficial parts,
  the two chief things attributed to Bodies as White are made to be,
  Fir&#383;t, that its Little Protuberances and Superficial parts be of
  &#383;omewhat a Specular Nature, that they may as little
  Looking-gla&#383;&#383;es each of them Reflect the Beams it <!-- Page 97
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97"></a>[pg 97]</span> receives,
  (or the little Picture of the Sun made on it) without otherwi&#383;e
  con&#383;iderably Altering them; whereas in mo&#383;t other Colours, they
  are wont to be much Chang'd, by being al&#383;o Refracted, or by being
  Return'd to the Eye, mixt with Shades or otherwi&#383;e. And next, that
  its Superficial parts be &#383;o Situated, that they Retain not the
  Incident Rays of Light by Reflecting them Inwards, but Send them
  almo&#383;t all Back, &#383;o that the Outermo&#383;t Corpu&#383;cles of
  a White Body, having their Various Little Surfaces of a Specular Nature,
  a Man can from no place Behold the Body, but that there will be among
  tho&#383;e Innumerable <i>Superficieculæ</i>, that Look &#383;ome one
  way, and &#383;ome another, enough of them Obverted to his Eye, to afford
  like a broken Looking-gla&#383;s, a confu&#383;ed Idæa, or
  Repre&#383;entation of Light, and make &#383;uch an Impre&#383;&#383;ion
  on the Organ, as that for which Men are wont to call a Body White. But
  this Notion will perhaps be be&#383;t Explan'd by the &#383;ame
  Experiments and Ob&#383;ervations, on which it is Built, And therefore I
  &#383;hall now advance to <i>Them</i>.</p>

  <p>4. And in the fir&#383;t place I con&#383;ider, that the Sun and other
  Powerfully Lucid Bodies, are not only wont to Offend, which we call to
  Dazle our Eyes, but that if any <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_98"></a>[pg 98]</span> Colour be to be A&#383;crib'd to them
  as they are Lucid, it &#383;eems it &#383;hould be Whitene&#383;s: For
  the Sun at Noon-day, and in Clear weather, and when his Face is le&#383;s
  Troubled, and as it were Stained by the Steams of Sublunary Bodies, and
  when his Beams have much le&#383;s of the Atmo&#383;phere to Traject in
  their Pa&#383;&#383;age to our Eyes, appears of a Colour more approaching
  to White, than when nearer the Horizon, the Interpo&#383;ition of certain
  Sorts of Fumes and Vapours make him oftentimes appear either Red, or at
  lea&#383;t more Yellow. And when the Sun Shines upon that Natural
  Looking-gla&#383;s, a Smooth water, that part of it, which appears to
  this or that particular Beholder, the mo&#383;t Shin'd on, does to his
  Eye &#383;eem far Whiter than the re&#383;t. And here I &#383;hall add,
  that I have &#383;ometimes had the Opportunity to ob&#383;erve a thing,
  that may make to my pre&#383;ent purpo&#383;e, namely, that when the Sun
  was Veil'd over as it were, with a Thin White Cloud, and yet was too
  Bright to be Look'd upon Directly without Dazling, by ca&#383;ting my
  Eyes upon a Smooth water, as we &#383;ometimes do to ob&#383;erve
  Eclip&#383;es without prejudice to our Eyes, the Sun then not far from
  the Meridian, appear'd to me not Red, but &#383;o White, that 'twas <!--
  Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99"></a>[pg 99]</span> not
  without &#383;ome Wonder, that I made the Ob&#383;ervation. Be&#383;ides,
  though we in <i>Engli&#383;h</i> are wont to &#383;ay, a thing is Red
  hot, as an Expre&#383;&#383;ion of its being Superlatively
  <i>Ignitum</i>, (if I may &#383;o Speak for want of a proper
  <i>Engli&#383;h</i> word) yet in the Forges of Smiths, and the Furnaces
  of other Artificers, by that which they call a White heat, they mean a
  further Degree of <i>Ignition</i>, than by that which both they and we
  call a Red heat.</p>

  <p>5. Secondly, I con&#383;ider, that common Experience informs us, that
  as much Light Over-powers the Eye, &#383;o when the Ground is covered
  with Snow, (a Body extremely White) tho&#383;e that have Weak Eyes are
  wont to complain of too much Light: And even tho&#383;e that have not,
  are generally Sen&#383;ible of an Extraordinary mea&#383;ure of Light in
  the Air; and if they are fain to Look very long upon the Snow, find their
  Sight Offended by it. On which occa&#383;ion we may call to mind what
  <i>Xenophon</i> relates, that his <i>Cyrus</i> marching his Army for
  divers days through Mountains covered with Snow, the Dazling
  &#383;plendor of its Whitene&#383;s prejudic'd the Sight of very many of
  his Souldiers, and Blinded &#383;ome of them; and other Stories of that
  Nature be met with in Writers of good <!-- Page 100 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100"></a>[pg 100]</span> Note. And the like
  has been affirm'd to me by credible Per&#383;ons of my own Acquaintance,
  and e&#383;pecially by one who though Skill'd in Phy&#383;ick and not
  Ancient confe&#383;s'd to me when I purpo&#383;ely ask'd him, that not
  only during his &#383;tay in <i>Mu&#383;covy</i>, he found his Eyes much
  Impair'd, by being reduc'd frequently to Travel in the Snow, but that the
  Weakne&#383;s of his Eyes did not Leave him when he left that Country,
  but has follow'd him into the&#383;e Parts, and yet continues to Trouble
  him. And to this doth agree what I as well as others have ob&#383;erv'd,
  namely, that when I Travell'd by Night, when the Ground was all cover'd
  with Snow, though the Night otherwi&#383;e would not have been
  Light&#383;ome, yet I could very well &#383;ee to Choo&#383;e my way. But
  much more Remarkable to my pre&#383;ent purpo&#383;e is that, which I
  have met with in <i>Olaus Magnus</i>,<a name="NtA_8"></a><a
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>8</sup></a> concerning the way of Travelling in Winter
  in the <i>Northern</i> Regions, where the Days of that Sea&#383;on are
  &#383;o very Short; for after other things not needfull to be here
  Tran&#383;cribed: <i>Iter</i>, &#383;ays he, <i>Diurnum duo &#383;cilicet
  montana milliaria (quæ 12 Italica &#383;unt) con&#383;iciunt. Nocte verò
  &#383;ub &#383;plendi&#383;&#383;ima luna, duplatum iter con&#383;umunt
  aut triplatum. Neque id incommodè fit, <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101"></a>[pg 101]</span> cum nivium
  reverberatione lunaris &#383;plendo<sup>ris</sup> &#383;ublimes &amp;
  declives campos illu&#383;tret, ac etiam montium præcipitia ac noxias
  feras à lorgè pro&#383;piciant evitandas</i>. Which Te&#383;timony I the
  le&#383;s Scruple to allege, becau&#383;e that it agrees very well with
  what has been Affirm'd to me by a Phy&#383;ician of <i>Mo&#383;co</i>,
  whom the Notion I have been Treating of concerning Whitene&#383;s invited
  me to ask whether he could not See much farther when he Travell'd by
  Night in <i>Ru&#383;&#383;ia</i> than he could do in <i>England</i>, or
  el&#383;ewhere, when there was no Snow upon the Ground; For this
  Ingenious Per&#383;on inform'd me, that he could See Things at a farr
  greater Di&#383;tance, and with more Clearne&#383;s, when he Travell'd by
  Night on the <i>Ru&#383;&#383;ian</i> Snow, though without the
  A&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of Moon-&#383;hine, than we in the&#383;e Parts
  would ea&#383;ily be per&#383;waded. Though it &#383;eems not unlikely to
  me, that the Inten&#383;ene&#383;s of the Cold may contribute
  &#383;omething to the con&#383;iderablene&#383;s of the Effect, by much
  Clearing the Air of Darki&#383;h Steams, which in the&#383;e more
  Temperate Climates are wont to Thicken it in Snowy weather: For having
  purpo&#383;ely inquir'd of this Doctor, and con&#383;ulted that Ingenious
  Navigator Captain <i>James</i>'s Voyage hereafter to be further
  mention'd, I find both their Relations <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102"></a>[pg 102]</span> agree in this,
  that in Dark Fro&#383;ty Nights they could Di&#383;cover more Stars, and
  See the re&#383;t Clearer than we in <i>England</i> are wont to do.</p>

  <p>6. I know indeed that divers Learned Men think, that Snow &#383;o
  &#383;trongly Affects our Eye, not by a Borrow'd, but a Native Light; But
  I venture to give it as a Proof, that White Bodies reflect more Light
  than Others, becau&#383;e having once purpo&#383;ely plac'd a parcel of
  Snow in a Room carefully Darkned, that no Cele&#383;tial Light might come
  to fall upon it; neither I, nor an ingenous Per&#383;on, (Skill'd in
  Opticks) whom I de&#383;ir'd for a Witne&#383;s, could find, that it had
  any other Light than what it receiv'd. And however, 'tis u&#383;ual among
  tho&#383;e that Travel in Dark Nights, that the Guides wear
  &#383;omething of White to be Di&#383;cern'd by, there being &#383;carce
  any Night &#383;o Dark, but that in the Free Air there remains &#383;ome
  Light, though Broken and Debilitated perhaps by a thou&#383;and
  Reflections from the Opacous Corpu&#383;cles that Swim in the Air, and
  lend it to one another before it comes to arrive at the Eye.</p>

  <p>7. Thirdly, And the better to &#383;hew that White Bodies reflect
  &#383;tore of Light, in compar&#383;on of tho&#383;e that are
  otherwi&#383;e Colour'd, I did in the Darkn'd Room, <!-- Page 103
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103"></a>[pg 103]</span> formerly
  mention'd, hold not far from the Hole, at which the Light was admitted, a
  Sheet only of White Paper, from whence ca&#383;ting the Sun-beams upon a
  White Wall, whereunto it was Obverted, it manife&#383;tly appear'd both
  to Me, and to the Per&#383;on I took for a Witne&#383;s of the
  Experiment, that it Reflected a far greater Light, than any of the other
  Colours formerly mention'd, the Light &#383;o thrown upon one Wall
  notably Enlightning it, and by it a good part of the Room. And yet
  further to &#383;how you, that White Bodies Reflect the Beams From them,
  and not Towards them&#383;elves, Let me add, that Ordinary
  Burning-gla&#383;&#383;es, &#383;uch as are wont to be employ'd to light
  Tobacco, will not in a great while Burn, or &#383;o much as
  Di&#383;colour a Sheet of White Paper. In&#383;omuch that even when I was
  a Boy, and Lov'd to make Tryals with Burning-gla&#383;&#383;es, I could
  not but wonder at this Odd <i>Phænomenon</i>, which &#383;et me very
  Early upon Gue&#383;&#383;ing at the Nature of Whitene&#383;s,
  e&#383;pecially becau&#383;e I took notice, that the Image of the Sun
  upon a White Paper was not &#383;o well Defin'd (the Light &#383;eeming
  too Diffus'd) as upon Black, and becau&#383;e I try'd, that Blacking over
  the Paper with Ink, not only the Ink would be quickly Dry'd up, but the
  <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104"></a>[pg
  104]</span> Paper that I could not Burn before, would be quickly &#383;et
  on Fire. I have al&#383;o try'd, that by expo&#383;ing my Hand with a
  Thin Black Glove over it to the Warm Sun, it was thereby very quickly and
  con&#383;iderably more Heated, than if I took off the Glove, and held my
  Hand Naked, or put on it another Glove of Thin but White Leather. And
  having thus &#383;hewn you, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, that White Bodies reflect
  the mo&#383;t Light of any, let us now proceed, to con&#383;ider what is
  further to be taken notice of in them, in order to our pre&#383;ent
  Enquiry.</p>

  <p>8. And Fourthly, whereas among the Di&#383;po&#383;itions we
  attributed to White Bodies, we al&#383;o intimated this, That &#383;uch
  Bodies are apt, like <i>Speculums</i>, though but Imperfect ones, to
  Reflect the Light that falls on them Untroubled or Un&#383;tain'd, we
  &#383;hall be&#383;ides other particulars to be met with in the&#383;e
  Papers, offer you this in favour of the Conjecture; That in the Darkned
  Room &#383;everal times mention'd in this Treat&#383;e, we try'd that the
  Sun-beams being ca&#383;t from a Coloured Body upon a neighbouring White
  Wall, the Determinate Colour of the Body was from the Wall reflected to
  the Eye; whereas we could in divers ca&#383;es manife&#383;tly Alter the
  Colour arriving at the Eye, by Sub&#383;tituting <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105"></a>[pg 105]</span> at a convenient
  Di&#383;tance, a (conveniently) Colour'd (and Glo&#383;&#383;y) Body
  in&#383;tead of the White Wall. As by throwing the Beams from a Yellow
  Body upon a Blew, there would be Exhibited a kind of Green, as in the
  Experiments about Colours is more fully Declar'd.</p>

  <p>9. I know not whether I &#383;hould on this Occa&#383;ion take notice,
  that when, as when looking upon the Calm and Smooth Surface of a River
  betwixt my Eye and the Sun, it appear'd to be a natural <i>Speculum</i>,
  wherein that Part which Reflected to my Eye the Entire and defin'd Image
  of the Sun, and the Beams le&#383;s remote from tho&#383;e which
  exhibited That Image, appear'd indeed of a great and Whiti&#383;h
  Brightne&#383;s, but the re&#383;t Comparatively Dark enough: if
  afterwards the Superficies chanc'd to be a little, but not much troubled,
  by a gentle Breath of Wind, and thereby reduc'd into a Multitude of Small
  and Smooth <i>Speculums</i>, the Surface of the River would &#383;uitably
  to the Doctrine lately deliver'd, at a Di&#383;tance appear very much of
  Kin to White, though it would lo&#383;e that Brightne&#383;s or
  Whitene&#383;s upon the Return of the Surface to Calmne&#383;s and an
  Uniform Level. And I have &#383;ometimes for Tryals &#383;ake brought in
  by a Lenticular Gla&#383;s, the Image of a River, Shin'd upon <!-- Page
  106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106"></a>[pg 106]</span> by
  the Sun, into an Upper Room Darkn'd, and Di&#383;tant about a Quarter of
  a Mile from the River, by which means the Numerous Declining Surfaces of
  the Water appear'd &#383;o Contracted, that upon the Body that receiv'd
  the Images, the whole River appear'd a very White Object at two or three
  paces di&#383;tance. But if we drew Near it, this Whitene&#383;s appear'd
  to proceed from an Innumerable company of Lucid Reflections, from the
  &#383;everal Gently wav'd Superficies of the Water, which look'd Near at
  hand like a Multitude of very Little, but Shining Scales of Fi&#383;h, of
  which many did every moment Di&#383;appear, and as many were by the Sun,
  Wind and River generated anew. But though this Ob&#383;ervation
  &#383;eem'd Sufficiently to di&#383;cover, how the Appearing
  Whitene&#383;s in that ca&#383;e was Produc'd, yet in &#383;ome other
  ca&#383;es Water may have the Same, though not &#383;o Vivid a Colour
  upon other Accounts; for oftentimes it happens that the Smooth Surface of
  the Water does appear Bright or Whiti&#383;h, by rea&#383;on of the
  Reflection not immediatly of the Images of the Sun, but of the
  Brightne&#383;s of the Sky; and in &#383;uch ca&#383;es a Convenient Wind
  may where it pa&#383;&#383;es along make the Surface look Black, by
  cau&#383;ing many &#383;uch Furrows and Cavities, as may make the
  Inflected Superficies <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_107"></a>[pg 107]</span> of the Water reflect the
  Brightne&#383;s of the Sky rather Inward than Outward. And again if the
  Wind increa&#383;e into a Storm, the Water may appear White,
  e&#383;pecially near the Shore and the Ship, namely becau&#383;e the Rude
  Agitation Breaks it into Fome or Froth. So much do Whitene&#383;s and
  Blackne&#383;s depend upon the Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the Superficial
  parts of a Body to Reflect the Beams of Light Inward or Outward. But that
  as White Bodies reflect the mo&#383;t Light of any, &#383;o there
  Superficial Particles are, in the Sen&#383;e newly Deliver'd, of a
  Specular Nature, I &#383;hall now further endeavour to &#383;hew both by
  the making of Specular bodies White, and the making of a White body
  Specular.</p>

  <p>10. In the Fifth place then, I will inform You, that (not to repeat
  what <i>Ga&#383;&#383;endus</i> ob&#383;erves concerning Water) I have
  for Curio&#383;ity &#383;ake Di&#383;till'd Quick&#383;ilver in a
  Cucurbit, fitted with a Capacious Gla&#383;s-head, and ob&#383;erv'd that
  when the Operation was perform'd by the Degrees of Fire requi&#383;ite
  for my purpo&#383;e, there would &#383;tick to the In&#383;ide of the
  Alembick a multitude of Little round drops of <i>Mercury</i>. And as you
  know that <i>Mercury</i> is a Specular Body, &#383;o each of the&#383;e
  Little drops was a &#383;mall round Looking-gla&#383;s, <!-- Page 108
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108"></a>[pg 108]</span> and a
  Multitude of them lying Thick and Near one another, they did both in my
  Judgment, and that of tho&#383;e I Invited to &#383;ee it, make the
  Gla&#383;s they were fa&#383;tened to, appear manife&#383;tly a White
  Body. And yet as I &#383;aid, this Whitene&#383;s depended upon the
  Minutene&#383;s and Nearne&#383;s of the Little Mercurial <i>Globuli</i>,
  the Convexity of who&#383;e Surfaces fitted them to repre&#383;ent in a
  Narrow compa&#383;s a Multitude of Little Lucid Images to differingly
  &#383;ituated Beholders. And here let me ob&#383;erve a thing that
  &#383;eems much to countenance the Notion I have been recommending:
  namely, that whereas divers parts of the Sky, and e&#383;pecially the
  Milky-way, do to the naked Eye appear White, (as the name it &#383;elf
  imports) yet the Galaxie look'd upon through the Tele&#383;cope, does not
  &#383;hew White, but appears to be made up of a Va&#383;t multitude of
  Little Starrs; &#383;o that a Multitude of Lucid Bodies, if they be
  &#383;o Small that they cannot Singly or apart be di&#383;cern'd by the
  Eye, and if they be &#383;ufficiently Thick &#383;et by one another, may
  by their confus'd beams appear to the Eye One White Body. And why it is
  not po&#383;&#383;ible, that the like may be done, when a Multitude of
  Bright and Little Corpu&#383;cles being crowded together, are made to
  &#383;end together Vivid beams to the Eye, <!-- Page 109 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109"></a>[pg 109]</span> though they Shine
  but as the Planets by a Borrow'd Light?</p>

  <p>11. But to return to our Experiments. We may take notice, That the
  White of an Egg, though in part Tran&#383;parent, yet by its power of
  Reflecting &#383;ome Incident Rays of Light, is in &#383;ome mea&#383;ure
  a Natural <i>Speculum</i>, being long agitated with a Whisk or Spoon,
  lo&#383;es its Tran&#383;parency, and becomes very White, by being turn'd
  into Froth, that is into an Aggregate of Numerous &#383;mall Bubbles,
  who&#383;e Convex Superficies fits them to Reflect the Light every way
  Outwards. And 'tis worth Noting, that when Water, for in&#383;tance, is
  Agitated into Froth, if the Bubbles be Great and Few, the Whitene&#383;s
  will be but Faint, becau&#383;e the number of <i>Specula</i> within a
  Narrow compa&#383;s is but Small, and they are not Thick &#383;et enough
  to Reflect &#383;o Many Little Images or Beams of the Lucid Body, as are
  requi&#383;ite to produce a Vigorous &#383;en&#383;ation of
  Whitene&#383;s: And partly lea&#383;t it &#383;hould be &#383;aid, that
  the Whitene&#383;s of &#383;uch Globulous Particles proceeds from the Air
  Included in the Froth; (which to make good, it &#383;hould be prov'd that
  the Air it &#383;elf is White) and partly to illu&#383;trate the better
  the Notion we have propos'd of Whitene&#383;s, I &#383;hall add, that I
  purpo&#383;ely made this Experiment, I took a quantity <!-- Page 110
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110"></a>[pg 110]</span> Fair
  water, &amp; put to it in a clear Gla&#383;s phial, a convenient quantity
  of Oyl or Spirit of Turpentine, becau&#383;e that Liquor will not
  incorporate with Water, and yet is almo&#383;t as Clear and
  Colourle&#383;s as it; the&#383;e being Gently Shaken together, the
  Agitation breaks the Oyl (which as I &#383;aid, is Indi&#383;pos'd to Mix
  like Wine or Milk <i>per minima</i> with the Water) into a Multitude of
  Little Globes, which each of them Reflecting Outwards a Lucid Image, make
  the Imperfect Mixture of the two Liquors appear Whiti&#383;h; but if by
  Vehemently Shaking the Gla&#383;s for a competent time you make a further
  Comminution of the Oyl into far more Numerous and Smaller <i>Globuli</i>,
  and thereby confound it al&#383;o better with the Water, the Mixture will
  appear of a Much greater Whitene&#383;s, and almo&#383;t like Milk;
  whereas if the Gla&#383;s be a while let alone, the Colour will by
  degrees Impair, as the Oyly globes grow Fewer and Bigger, and at length
  will quite Vani&#383;h, leaving both the Liquors Di&#383;tinct and
  Diaphanous as before. And &#383;uch a Tryal hath not ill &#383;ucceeded,
  when in&#383;teed of the Colourle&#383;s Oyl of Turpentine I took a
  Yellow Mixture made of a good Proportion of Crude Turpentine
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd in that Liquor; and (if I mis-remember not) it
  al&#383;o Succeeded better than one would <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111"></a>[pg 111]</span> expect, when I
  employ'd an Oyl brought by Filings of Copper infu&#383;ed in it, to a
  deep Green. And this (by the way) may be the Rea&#383;on, why often times
  when the Oyls of &#383;ome Spices and of Anni&#383;eeds &amp;c. are
  Di&#383;tilled in a Limbec with Water, the Water (as I have &#383;everal
  times ob&#383;erv'd) comes over Whiti&#383;h, and will perhaps continue
  &#383;o for a good while, becau&#383;e if the Fire be made too Strong,
  the &#383;ubtile Chymical Oyl is thereby much Agitated and Broken, and
  Blended with the Water in &#383;uch Numerous and Minute Globules, as
  cannot ea&#383;ily in a &#383;hort time Emerge to the Top of the Water,
  and whil&#383;t they Remain in it, make it, for the Rea&#383;on newly
  intimated, look Whiti&#383;h; and perhaps upon the &#383;ame Ground a
  cau&#383;e may be rendred, why Hot water is ob&#383;erv'd to be
  u&#383;ually more Opacous and Whiti&#383;h, than the &#383;ame Water
  Cold, the Agitation turning the more Spirituous or otherwi&#383;e
  Conveniently Di&#383;pos'd Particles of the Water into Vapours, thereby
  Producing in the Body of the Liquor a Multitude of Small Bubbles, which
  interrupt the Free pa&#383;&#383;age, that the Beams of Light would
  el&#383;e have Every way, and from the Innermo&#383;t parts of the Water
  Reflect many of them Outwards. The&#383;e and the like Examples,
  <i>Pyrophilus</i>, <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_112"></a>[pg 112]</span> have induc'd me to Su&#383;pect, that
  the Superficial Particles of White bodies, may for the Mo&#383;t part be
  as well Convex as Smooth; I content my &#383;elf to &#383;ay
  <i>Su&#383;pect</i> and <i>for the mo&#383;t part</i>, becau&#383;e it
  &#383;eems not Ea&#383;ie to prove, that when Diaphanous bodies, as we
  &#383;hall &#383;ee by and by, are reduc'd into White Powders, each
  Corpu&#383;cle mu&#383;t needs be of a Convex Superficies, &#383;ince
  perhaps it may Suffice that Specular Surfaces look &#383;everally ways.
  For (as we have &#383;een) when a Diaphanous Body comes to be reduc'd to
  very Minute parts, it thereby requires a Multitude of Little Surfaces
  within a Narrow compa&#383;s. And though each of the&#383;e &#383;hould
  not be of a Figure Convenient to Reflect a Round Image of the Sun, yet
  even from &#383;uch an Inconveniently Figur'd body, there may be
  Reflected &#383;ome (either Streight or Crooked) Phy&#383;ical Line of
  Light, which Line I call Phy&#383;ical, becau&#383;e it has &#383;ome
  Breadth in it, and in which Line in many ca&#383;es &#383;ome Refraction
  of the Light falling upon the Body it depends on, may contribute to the
  Brightne&#383;s, as if a Slender Wire, or Solid Cylinder of Gla&#383;s be
  expos'd to the Light, you &#383;hall &#383;ee in &#383;ome part of it a
  vivid Line of Light, and if we were able to draw out and lay together a
  Multitude of the&#383;e Little <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_113"></a>[pg 113]</span> Wires or Thrids of Gla&#383;s,
  &#383;o Slender, that the Eye could not di&#383;cern a Di&#383;tance
  betwixt the Luminous Lines, there is little doubt (as far as I can
  gue&#383;s by a Tryal purpo&#383;ely made with very Slender, but far
  le&#383;s Slender Thrids of Gla&#383;s, who&#383;e Aggregate was Look'd
  upon one way White) but the whole Phy&#383;ical Superficies compos'd of
  them, would to the Eye appear White, and if &#383;o, it will not be
  always nece&#383;&#383;ary that the Figure of tho&#383;e Corpu&#383;cles,
  that make a Body appear White, &#383;hould be <i>Globulous</i>. And as
  for Snow it &#383;elf, though the Learned <i>Ga&#383;&#383;endus</i> (as
  we have &#383;een above) makes it to &#383;eem nothing el&#383;e but a
  pure Frozen Froth, con&#383;i&#383;ting of exceedingly Minute and
  Thick&#383;et Bubbles; yet I &#383;ee no nece&#383;&#383;ity of Admitting
  that, &#383;ince not only by the Variou&#383;ly and Curiou&#383;ly
  Figur'd Snow, that I have divers times had the Opportunity with
  Plea&#383;ure to ob&#383;erve, but al&#383;o by the Common Snow, it
  rather doth appear both to the Naked Eye, and in a
  <i>Micro&#383;cope</i>, often, if not mo&#383;t commonly, to
  con&#383;i&#383;t principally of Little Slender Icicles of &#383;everal
  Shapes, which afford &#383;uch Numerous Lines of Light, as we have been
  newly Speaking of.</p>

  <p>12. Sixthly, If you take a Diaphanous Body, as for in&#383;tance a
  Piece of Gla&#383;s, and <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_114"></a>[pg 114]</span> reduce it to Powder, the &#383;ame
  Body, which when it was Entire, freely Tran&#383;mitted the Beams of
  Light, acquiring by Contu&#383;ion a multitude of Minute Surfaces, each
  of which is as it were a Little, but Imperfect <i>Speculum</i>, is
  qualify'd to Reflect in a Confus'd manner, &#383;o many either Beams, or
  Little and Singly Unob&#383;ervable Images of the Lucid Body, that from a
  Diaphanous it Degenerates into a White Body. And I remember, I have for
  Trials &#383;ake taken Lumps of Rock Cry&#383;tal, and Heating them Red
  hot in a Crucible, I found according to my Expectation, that being
  Quench'd in Fair water, even tho&#383;e that remain'd in &#383;eemingly
  entire Lumps exchang'd their Tran&#383;lucency for Whitene&#383;s, the
  Ignition and Extinction having as it were Crack'd each Lump into a
  multitude of Minute Bodies, and thereby given it a great multitude of new
  Surfaces. And ev'n with Diaphanous Bodies, that are Colour'd, there may
  be this way a Greater Degree of Whitene&#383;s produced, than one would
  lightly think; as I remember, I have by Contu&#383;ion obtain'd
  Whiti&#383;h Powders of <i>Granates</i>, Gla&#383;s of <i>Antimony</i>,
  and <i>Emeralds</i> finely Beaten, and you may more ea&#383;ily make the
  Experiment, by taking Good Venereal <i>Vitriol</i> of a Deep Blew, <!--
  Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115"></a>[pg 115]</span>
  and comparing with &#383;ome of the Entire Cry&#383;talls purpo&#383;ely
  re&#383;erv'd, &#383;ome of the Subtile Powder of the &#383;ame Salt,
  which will Comparatively exhibit a very con&#383;iderable degree of
  Whiti&#383;hne&#383;s.</p>

  <p>13. Seventhly, And as by a Change of Po&#383;ition in the Parts, a
  Body that is not White, may be made White, &#383;o by a Slight change of
  the Texture of its Surface, a White Body may be Depriv'd of its
  Whitene&#383;s. For if, (as I have try'd in Gold-&#383;miths Shops) you
  take a piece of Silver that has been fre&#383;hly Boyl'd, as the
  Artificers call it, (which is done by, fir&#383;t Bru&#383;hing, and then
  Decocting it with Salt and Tartar, and perhaps &#383;ome other
  Ingredients) you &#383;hall find it to be of a Lovely White. But if you
  take a piece of Smooth Steel, and therewith Burni&#383;h a part of it,
  which may be pre&#383;ently done, you &#383;hall find that Part will
  Lo&#383;e its Whitene&#383;s, and turn a <i>Speculum</i>, looking
  almo&#383;t every where Dark, as other Looking-gla&#383;&#383;es do,
  which may not a little confirm our Doctrine. For by this we may
  gue&#383;s, what it is chiefly that made the Body White before, by
  con&#383;idering that all that was done to deprive it of that
  Whitene&#383;s, was only to Depre&#383;s the Little Protuberances that
  were before on the Surface of the Silver <!-- Page 116 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116"></a>[pg 116]</span> into one Continu'd
  Superficies, and thereby effect this, that now the Image of the Lucid
  Body, and con&#383;equently a Kind of Whitene&#383;s &#383;hall appear to
  your Eye, but in &#383;ome place of the greater Silver Looking-gla&#383;s
  (whence the Beams reflected at an Angle Equal to that wherewith they fall
  on it, may reach your Eye) whil&#383;t the A&#383;perity remain'd
  Unde&#383;troy'd, the Light falling on innumerable Little <i>Specula</i>
  Obverted &#383;ome one way, and &#383;ome another, did from all
  Sen&#383;ibly Di&#383;tingui&#383;hable parts of the Superficies reflect
  confus'd Beams or Repre&#383;entations of Light to the Beholders Eye,
  from whence &#383;oever he chance to Look upon it. And among the
  Experiments annex'd to this Di&#383;cour&#383;e, you will find One,
  wherein by the Change of Texture in Bodies, Whitene&#383;s is in a Trice
  both Generated and De&#383;troy'd.</p>

<h3>CHAP. II.</h3>

  <p>1. What we have Di&#383;cours'd of Whitene&#383;s, may &#383;omewhat
  A&#383;&#383;i&#383;t us to form a Notion of Blackne&#383;s, tho&#383;e
  two Qualities being Contrary enough to Illu&#383;trate each other. Yet
  among the Antient <i>Philo&#383;ophers</i> I find le&#383;s
  A&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_117"></a>[pg 117]</span> to form a Notion of Blackne&#383;s
  than of Whitene&#383;s, only <i>Democritus</i> in the pa&#383;&#383;age
  above Recited out of <i>Aristotle</i> has given a General Hint of the
  Cau&#383;e of this Colour, by referring the Blackne&#383;s of Bodies to
  their A&#383;perity. But this I call but a General Hint, becau&#383;e
  tho&#383;e Bodies that are Green, and Purple, and Blew, &#383;eem to be
  &#383;o as well as Black ones, upon the Account of their Superficial
  A&#383;perity. But among the <i>Moderns</i>, the formerly mention'd
  <i>Ga&#383;&#383;endus</i>, perhaps invited by this Hint of
  <i>Democritus</i>, has Incidentally in another Epi&#383;tle given us,
  though a very Short, yet a &#383;omewhat Clearer account of the Nature of
  Blackne&#383;s in the&#383;e words: <i>Existimare par est corpora
  &#383;uâpte Naturâ nigra constare ex particulis, quarum Superficieculæ
  &#383;cabræ &#383;int, nec facilè lucem extror&#383;um reflectant.</i> I
  wi&#383;h this Ingenious Man had enlarg'd him&#383;elf upon this Subject;
  For indeed it &#383;eems, that as that which makes a Body White, is
  chiefly &#383;uch a Di&#383;po&#383;ition of its Parts, that it Reflects
  (I mean without much Interruption) more of the Light that falls on it,
  than Bodies of any other Colour do, &#383;o that which makes a Body Black
  is principally a Peculiar kind of Texture, chiefly of its Superficial
  Particle, whereby it does as it were Dead the Light <!-- Page 118
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118"></a>[pg 118]</span> that
  falls on it, &#383;o that very little is Reflected Outwards to the
  Eye.</p>

  <p>2. And this Texture may be Explicated two, and perhaps more than two
  &#383;everal ways, whereof the fir&#383;t is by Suppo&#383;ing in the
  Superficies of the Black Body a Particular kind of A&#383;perity, whereby
  the Superficial Particles reflect but Few of the Incident Beams Outwards,
  and the re&#383;t Inwards towards the Body it &#383;elf. As if for
  In&#383;tance, we &#383;hould conceive the Surface of a Black Body to be
  A&#383;perated by an almo&#383;t Numberle&#383;s throng of Little
  Cylinders, Pyramids, Cones, and other &#383;uch Corpu&#383;cles, which by
  their being Thick Set and <i>Erected</i>, reflect the Beams of Light from
  one to another Inwards, and &#383;end them too and fro &#383;o often,
  that at length they are Lo&#383;t before they can come to Rebound out
  again to the Eye. And this is the fir&#383;t of the two mention'd ways of
  Explicating Blackne&#383;s. The other way is by Suppo&#383;ing the
  Texture of Black Bodies to be &#383;uch, that either by their Yielding to
  the Beams of Light, or upon &#383;ome other Account, they do as it were
  Dead the Beams of Light, and keep them from being Reflected in any
  Plenty, or with any Con&#383;iderable Vigour of Motion, Outwards.
  According to this Notion it may be &#383;aid, that <!-- Page 119 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119"></a>[pg 119]</span> the
  Corpu&#383;cles that make up the Beams of Light, whether they be Solary
  <i>Effluviums</i>, or Minute Particles of &#383;ome Ætherial
  Sub&#383;tance, Thru&#383;ting on one another from the Lucid Body, do,
  falling on Black Bodies, meet with &#383;uch a Texture, that &#383;uch
  Bodies receive Into them&#383;elves, and Retain almo&#383;t all the
  Motion communicated to them by the Corpu&#383;cles that make up the Beams
  of Light, and con&#383;equently Reflect but Few of them, or tho&#383;e
  but Languidly, towards the Eye, it happening here almo&#383;t in like
  manner as to a ball, which thrown again&#383;t a Stone or Floor, would
  Rebound a great way Upwards, but Rebounds very Little or not at all, when
  it is thrown again&#383;t Water, or Mud, or a Loo&#383;e Net,
  becau&#383;e the Parts yield, and receive into them&#383;elves the
  Motion, on who&#383;e Account the Ball &#383;hould be Reflected Outwards.
  But this La&#383;t way of Explicating Blackne&#383;s, I &#383;hall
  content my Self to have Propos'd, without either Adopting it, or
  ab&#383;olutely Rejecting it. For the Hardne&#383;s of Touch&#383;tones,
  Black Marble and other Bodies, that being Black are Solid, &#383;eem to
  make it &#383;omewhat Improbable, that &#383;uch Bodies &#383;hould be of
  &#383;o Yielding a Texture, unle&#383;s we &#383;hould &#383;ay, that
  &#383;ome Bodies may be more Di&#383;pos'd to Yield to the Impul&#383;es
  of <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120"></a>[pg
  120]</span> the Corpu&#383;cles of Light by rea&#383;on of a Peculiar
  Texture, than other Bodies, that in other Tryals appear to be Softer than
  they. But though the Former of the&#383;e two Explications of
  Blackne&#383;s be that, by which we &#383;hall Endeavour to give an
  Account of it, yet as we &#383;aid, we &#383;hall not Ab&#383;olutely
  Reject this Latter, partly becau&#383;e they both Agree in this, that
  Black Bodies Reflect but Little of the Light that falls on them, and
  partly becau&#383;e it is not Impo&#383;&#383;ible, that in &#383;ome
  Ca&#383;es both the Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the Superficial particles,
  as to Figure and Po&#383;ition, and the Yielding of the Body, or
  &#383;ome of its Parts, may joyntly, though not in an Equal mea&#383;ure
  concurr to the rendring of a Body Black. The Con&#383;iderations that
  induc'd me to propo&#383;e this Notion of Blackne&#383;s, as I Explan'd
  it, are principally the&#383;e:</p>

  <p>3. Fir&#383;t, That as I lately &#383;aid, Whitene&#383;s and
  Blackne&#383;s being generally reputed to be Contrary Qualities,
  Whitene&#383;s depending as I &#383;aid upon the Di&#383;po&#383;ition of
  the Parts of a Body to Reflect much Light, it &#383;eems likely, that
  Blackne&#383;s may depend upon a Contrary Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the
  Black Bodies Surface; But upon this I &#383;hall not
  In&#383;i&#383;t.</p>

  <p>4. Next then we &#383;ee, that if a Body of <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121"></a>[pg 121]</span> One and the
  &#383;ame Colour be plac'd, part in the Sun-beams, and part in the Shade,
  that part which is not Shin'd on will appear more of Kin to
  Blackne&#383;s than the other, from which more Light Rebounds to the Eye;
  And Dark Colours &#383;eem the Blacker, the le&#383;s Light they are
  Look'd upon in, and we think all Things Black in the Dark, when they
  &#383;end no Beams to make Impre&#383;&#383;ions on our Organs of Sight,
  &#383;o that Shadows and Darkne&#383;s are near of Kin, and Shaddow we
  know is but a Privation of Light; and accordingly Blackne&#383;s
  &#383;eems to proceed from the Paucity of Beams Reflected from the Black
  Body to the Eye, I &#383;ay the Paucity of Beams, becau&#383;e tho&#383;e
  Bodies that we call Black, as Marble, Jeat, &amp;c. are Short of being
  perfectly &#383;o, el&#383;e we &#383;hould not See them at all. But
  though the Beams that fall on the Sides of tho&#383;e Erected Particles
  that we have been mentioning, do Few of them return Outwards, yet
  tho&#383;e that fall upon the Points of tho&#383;e Cylinders, Cones, or
  Pyramids, may thence Rebound to the Eye, though they make there but a
  Faint Impre&#383;&#383;ion, becau&#383;e they Arrive not there, but
  Mingl'd with a great Proportion of Little Shades. This may be Confirm'd
  by my having procur'd a Large piece of Black <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122"></a>[pg 122]</span> Marble well
  Poli&#383;h'd, and brought to the Form of a Large Sphærical and Concave
  <i>Speculum</i>; For on the In&#383;ide this Marble being well
  Poli&#383;h'd, was a kind of Dark Looking-gla&#383;s, wherein I could
  plainly &#383;ee a Little Image of the Sun, when that Shin'd upon it. But
  this Image was very far from Offending and Dazling my Eyes, as it would
  have done from another <i>Speculum</i>; Nor, though the <i>Speculum</i>
  were Large, could I in a Long time, or in a Hot Sun &#383;et a piece of
  Wood on Fire, though a far le&#383;s <i>Speculum</i> of the &#383;ame
  Form, and of a more Reflecting Matter, would have made it Flame in a
  Trice.</p>

  <p>5. And on this Occa&#383;ion we may as well in Reference to
  &#383;omething formerly deliver'd concerning Whitene&#383;s, as in
  Reference to what has been newly &#383;aid, Subjoyn what we further
  ob&#383;erv'd touching the Differing Reflections of Light from White and
  Black Marble, namely, that having taking a pretty Large Mortar of White
  Marble, New and Poli&#383;h'd in the In&#383;ide, and Expos'd it to the
  Sun, we found that it Reflected a great deal of Glaring Light, but
  &#383;o Di&#383;pers'd, that we could not make the Reflected Beams
  concurr in any &#383;uch Con&#383;picuous <i>Focus</i>, as that newly
  taken notice of in the Black Marble, though <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123"></a>[pg 123]</span> perhaps there may
  enough of them be made to meet near the Bottom, to make &#383;ome Kind of
  <i>Focus</i>, e&#383;pecially &#383;ince by holding in the Night-time a
  Candle at a convenient Di&#383;tance, we were able to procure a
  Concour&#383;e of &#383;ome, though not many of the Reflected Beams, at
  about two Inches di&#383;tant from the Bottom of the Mortar: But we found
  the Heat even of the Sunbeams &#383;o Di&#383;per&#383;edly Reflected to
  be very Languid, even in Compari&#383;on of the Black Marbles
  <i>Focus</i>. And the Little Picture of the Sun, that appear'd upon the
  White Marble as a <i>Speculum</i>, was but very Faint and exceeding ill
  Defin'd. Secondly, That taking two pieces of Plain and Poli&#383;h'd
  Surfaces, and ca&#383;ting on them Succe&#383;&#383;ively the Beams of
  the Same Candle, In &#383;uch manner, as that the Neighbouring
  Superficies being Shaded by an Opacous and Perforated Body, the Incident
  Beams were permitted to pa&#383;s but through a Round Hole of about Half
  an Inch Diameter, the Circle of Light that appear'd on the White Marble
  was in Compari&#383;on very Bright, but very ill Defin'd; whereas that on
  the Black Marble was far le&#383;s Luminous, but much more preci&#383;ely
  Defin'd.</p>

  <p>6. Thirdly, When you Look upon a piece of Linnen that has Small Holes
  in it, <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124"></a>[pg
  124]</span> tho&#383;e Holes appear very Black, and Men are often
  deceiv'd in taking Holes for Spots of Ink; And Painters to repre&#383;ent
  Holes, make u&#383;e of Black, the Rea&#383;on of which &#383;eems to be,
  that the Beams that fall on tho&#383;e Holes, fall into them So Deep,
  that none of them is Reflected back to the Eye. And in narrow Wells part
  of the Mouth &#383;eems Black, becau&#383;e the Incident Beams are
  Reflected Downwards from one &#383;ide to another, till they can no more
  Rebound to the Eye.</p>

  <p>We may con&#383;ider too, that if Differing parts of the &#383;ame
  piece of Black Velvet be &#383;troak'd Oppo&#383;ite ways, the piece of
  Velvet will appear of two Di&#383;tinct kinds of Blackne&#383;s, the one
  far Darker than the other, of which Di&#383;parity the Rea&#383;on Seems
  to be, that in the Le&#383;s ob&#383;cure part of the Velvet, the Little
  Silken Piles whereof 'tis made up, being Inclin'd, there is a Greater
  part of each of them Obverted to the Eye, whereas in the other part the
  Piles of Silk being more Erected, there are far Fewer Beams Reflected
  Outwards from the Lateral parts of each Pile, So that mo&#383;t of
  tho&#383;e that Rebound to the Eye, come from the Tops of the Piles,
  which make but a &#383;mall part of the whole Superficies, that may be
  cover'd by the piece of Velvet. <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_125"></a>[pg 125]</span> Which Explication I propo&#383;e, not
  that I think the Blackne&#383;s of the Velvet proceeds from the
  Cau&#383;e a&#383;&#383;ign'd, &#383;ince each Single Pile of Silk is
  Black by rea&#383;on of its Texture, in what Po&#383;ition &#383;oever
  you Look upon it; But that the Greater Blackne&#383;s of one of
  the&#383;e Tuffts &#383;eems to proceed from the Greater Paucity of Beams
  Reflected from it, and that from the Fewne&#383;s of tho&#383;e Parts of
  a Surface that Reflect Beams, and the Multitude of tho&#383;e Shaded
  Parts that Reflect none. And I remember, that I have oftentimes
  ob&#383;erv'd, that the Po&#383;ition of Particular Bodies far greater
  than Piles of Silk in reference to the Eye, may notwith&#383;tanding
  their having each of them a Colour of its own, make one part of their
  Aggregate appear far Darker than the other; For I have near Great Towns
  often taken notice, that a Cart-load of Carrots pack'd up, appear'd of a
  much Darker Colour when Look'd upon, where the Points of the Carrots were
  Obverted to the Eye, than where the Sides of them were &#383;o.</p>

  <p>7. Fourthly, In a Darkned Room, I purpo&#383;ely ob&#383;erv'd, that
  if the Sun-beams, which came in at the Hole were receiv'd upon White or
  any other Colour, and directed to a Convenient place of the Room, <!--
  Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126"></a>[pg 126]</span>
  they would Manife&#383;tly, though not all Equally, Encrea&#383;e the
  Light of that Part; whereas if we Sub&#383;tituted, either a piece of
  Black Cloth or Black Velvet, it would &#383;o Dead the Incident Beams,
  that the place (newly mention'd) whereto I Obverted the Black Body, would
  be Le&#383;s Enlightned than it was before, when it received its Light
  but from the Weak and Oblique Reflections of the Floor and Walls of a
  pretty Large Room, through which the Beams that came in at the Hole were
  Confu&#383;edly and Brokenly Di&#383;pers'd.</p>

  <p>8. Fifthly, And to &#383;hew that the Beams that fall on Black Bodies,
  as they do not Rebound Outwards to the Eye, &#383;o they are Reflected
  towards the Body it &#383;elf, as the Nature of tho&#383;e Erected
  Particles to which we have imputed Blackne&#383;s, requires, we will add
  an Experiment that will al&#383;o confirm our Doctrine touching
  Whitene&#383;s; Namely, that we took a Broad and Large Tile, and having
  Whitened over one half of the Superficies of it, and Black'd the other,
  we expos'd it to the Summer Sun; And having let it lye there a convenient
  time (for the Difference is more Apparent, if it have not lain there too
  long) we found, as we expected, that whil&#383;t the Whited part of the
  Tile remained Cool enough, the <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_127"></a>[pg 127]</span> Black'd part of the &#383;ame Tile
  was grown not only Sen&#383;ible, but very Hot, (&#383;ometimes to a
  &#383;trong Degree.) And to &#383;atisfie &#383;ome of our Friends the
  more, we have &#383;ometimes left upon the Surface of the Tile,
  be&#383;ides the White and Black parts thereof, a part that Retain'd the
  native Red of the Tile it &#383;elf, and Expo&#383;ing them to the Sun,
  we ob&#383;erv'd this La&#383;t mention'd to have Contracted a Heat in
  compari&#383;on of the White, but a Heat Inferiour to that of the Black,
  of which the Rea&#383;on &#383;eems to be, that the Superficial Particles
  of Black Bodies, being, as we &#383;aid, more Erected, than tho&#383;e of
  White or Red ones, the Corpu&#383;cles of Light falling on their
  &#383;ides, being for the mo&#383;t part Reflected Inwards from one
  Particle to another, and thereby engag'd as it were and kept from
  Rebounding Upwards, they communicate their brisk Motion, wherewith they
  were impell'd again&#383;t the Black Body, (upon who&#383;e account had
  they fallen upon a White Body, they would have been Reflected Outwards)
  to the Small parts of the Black Body, and thereby Produce in tho&#383;e
  Small parts &#383;uch an Agitation, as (when we feel it) we are wont to
  call Heat. I have been lately inform'd, that an Ob&#383;ervation near of
  Kin to Ours, has been made by &#383;ome Learned Men in <i>France</i> and
  <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128"></a>[pg
  128]</span> <i>Italy</i>, by long Expo&#383;ing to a very Hot Sun, two
  pieces of Marble, the one White, the other Black; But though the
  Ob&#383;ervation be worthy of them, and may confirm the &#383;ame Truth
  with Our Experiment, yet be&#383;ides that our Tryal needs not the
  Summer, nor any Great Heat to &#383;ucceed, It &#383;eems to have this
  Advantage above the other, that whereas Bodies more Solid, and of a
  Clo&#383;er Texture, though they u&#383;e to be more Slowly Heated, are
  wont to receive a Greater Degree of Heat from the Sun or Fire, than
  (<i>Cæteris paribus</i>) Bodies of a Slightest Texture; I have found by
  the Information of Stone-cutters, and by other ways of Enquiry, that
  Black Marble is much Solider and Harder than White, &#383;o that
  po&#383;&#383;ibly the Difference betwixt the Degrees of Heat they
  receive from the Sunbeams will by many be a&#383;crib'd to the Difference
  of their Texture, rather than to that of their Colour, though I think our
  Experiment will make it Probable enough that the greater part of that
  Difference may well be a&#383;crib'd to that Di&#383;po&#383;ition of
  Parts, which makes the one Reflect the Sunbeams Inward; and the other
  Outwards. And with this Doctrine accords very well, that Rooms hung with
  Black, are not only Darker than el&#383;e they would be, but are <!--
  Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129"></a>[pg 129]</span>
  wont to be Warmer too; In&#383;omuch that I have known a great Lady,
  who&#383;e Con&#383;titution was &#383;omewhat Tender, complain that
  &#383;he was wont to catch Cold, when &#383;he went out into the Air,
  after having made any long Vi&#383;its to Per&#383;ons, who&#383;e Rooms
  were hung with Black. And this is not the only Lady I have heard complain
  of the Warmth of &#383;uch Rooms, which though perhaps it may be partly
  imputed to the <i>Effluvia</i> of tho&#383;e Materials wherewith the
  hangings were Dy'd, yet probably the Warmth of &#383;uch Rooms depends
  chiefly upon the &#383;ame Cau&#383;e that the Darkne&#383;s does; As
  (not to repeat what I formerly Noted touching my Gloves,) to
  &#383;atisfie &#383;ome Curious Per&#383;ons of that Sex, I have
  convinc'd them, by Tryall, that of two Pieces of Silken Stuff given me by
  them&#383;elves, and expos'd in their Pre&#383;ence, to the &#383;ame
  Window, Shin'd on by that Sun, the White was <i>con&#383;iderably</i>
  Heated, when the Black was not &#383;o much as <i>Sen&#383;ibly</i>
  &#383;o.</p>

  <p>9. Sixthly, I remember, that Acquainting one Day a
  <i>Virtuo&#383;o</i> of Un&#383;u&#383;pected Credit, that had
  Vi&#383;ited Hot Countries, with part of what I have here Deliver'd
  concerning Blackne&#383;s, he Related to me by way of Confirmation of it,
  a very notable <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_130"></a>[pg 130]</span> Experiment, which he had both others
  make, and Made him&#383;elf in a Warm Climate, namely, that having
  carefully Black'd over Eggs, and Expos'd them to the Hot Sun, they were
  thereby in no very Long time well Roa&#383;ted, to which Effect I
  conceive the Heat of the Climate mu&#383;t have Concurr'd with the
  Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the Black Surface to Reflect the Sunbeams
  Inward, for I remember, that having made that among other Tryals in
  <i>England</i>, though in Summer-time, the Eggs I Expos'd, acquir'd
  indeed a con&#383;iderable Degree of Heat, but yet not &#383;o
  Inten&#383;e a One, as prov'd Sufficient to Roa&#383;t them.</p>

  <p>10. Seventhly, and La&#383;tly, Our Conjectures at the Nature of
  Blackne&#383;s may be &#383;omewhat Confirm'd by the (formerly mention'd)
  Ob&#383;ervation of the Blind <i>Dutch-man</i>, that Di&#383;cerns
  Colours with his Fingers; for he Says, that he Feels a greater
  Roughne&#383;s upon the Surfaces of Black Bodies, than upon tho&#383;e of
  Red, or Yellow, or Green. And I remember, that the Diligent
  <i>Bartholinus</i> &#383;ays,<a name="NtA_9"></a><a
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>9</sup></a> that a Blind Earl of <i>Mansfield</i> could
  Di&#383;tingui&#383;h White from Black only by the Touch, which would
  Sufficiently Argue a great Di&#383;parity in the A&#383;perities, or
  other <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131"></a>[pg
  131]</span> Superficial Textures of Bodies of tho&#383;e two Colours, if
  the Learn'd Relator had Affirm'd the Matter upon his own Knowledge.</p>

  <p>II. The&#383;e, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, are the chief things that Occurr to
  me at pre&#383;ent, about the Nature of Whitene&#383;s and
  Blackne&#383;s, which it they have Rendred it &#383;o much as Probable,
  that in <i>Mo&#383;t</i>; or at lea&#383;t <i>Many</i> Ca&#383;es, the
  Cau&#383;es of the&#383;e Qualities may be &#383;uch as I have Adventur'd
  to Deliver, it is as much as I Pretend to; for till I have Opportunity to
  Examine the Matter by &#383;ome further Tryals, I am not &#383;ure, but
  that in &#383;ome White and Black Bodies, there may Concurr to the Colour
  &#383;ome peculiar Texture or Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the Body, whereby
  the Motion of the Small Corpu&#383;cles that make up the Incident Beams
  of Light, may be Differingly Modify'd, before they reach the Eye,
  e&#383;pecially in this, that White Bodies do not only Copiou&#383;ly
  Reflect tho&#383;e Incident Corpu&#383;cles Outwards, but Reflect them
  Briskly, and do not otherwi&#383;e Alter them in the manner of their
  Motion. Nor &#383;hall I now &#383;tay to Enquire, whether &#383;ome of
  tho&#383;e other ways, (as a Di&#383;po&#383;ition to Alter the Velocity,
  the Rotation, or the Order and Manner of Appul&#383;e &#383;o the Eye of
  the Reflected Corpu&#383;cles <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_132"></a>[pg 132]</span> that Compos'd the Incident Beams of
  Light) which we mention'd when we con&#383;ider'd the Production of
  Colours in General, may not in &#383;ome Ca&#383;es be Applicable to
  tho&#383;e of White and Black Bodies: For I am yet &#383;o much a
  <i>Seeker</i> in this Matter, and &#383;o little Wedded to the Opinions I
  have propos'd, that what I am to add &#383;hall be but the Beginning of a
  Collection of Experiments and Ob&#383;ervation towards the Hi&#383;tory
  of Whitene&#383;s and Blackne&#383;s, without at pre&#383;ent
  interpo&#383;ing my Explications of them, that &#383;o, I may
  a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t your Enquires without much Fore-&#383;talling or
  Bia&#383;&#383;ing your Judgment.</p>

<h3>EXPERIMENT I.</h3>

  <p><img width="80" height="80" align="left" src="images/172b.png" alt="Illuminated H in Having" />
  Aving promis'd in the <a href="#Page_114">114</a>, and <a
  href="#Page_115">115</a>. Pages of the foregoing Di&#383;cour&#383;e of
  Whitene&#383;s and Blackne&#383;s, to &#383;hew, that tho&#383;e two
  Colours may by a change of Texture in bodies, each of them apart
  Diaphanous and Colourle&#383;s, be at plea&#383;ure and in a trice as
  well Generated as De&#383;troy'd, We &#383;hall begin with Experiments
  that may acquit us of that promi&#383;e.</p>

  <p>Take then what Quantity you plea&#383;e of Fair Water, and having
  Heated it, put into it as much good Common Sublimate, as it is able to
  Di&#383;&#383;olve, and (to be &#383;ure of having <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134"></a>[pg 134]</span> it well glutted:)
  continue putting in the Sublimate, till &#383;ome of it lye Untouch'd in
  the bottom of the Liquor, Filter this Solution through Cap-paper, to have
  it cleer and limpid, and into a &#383;poonfull or two thereof, (put into
  a clean gla&#383;s ve&#383;&#383;el,) &#383;hake about four or five drops
  (according as you took more or le&#383;s of this Solution) of good limpid
  Spirits of Urine, and immediately the whole mixture will appear White
  like Milk, to which mixture if you pre&#383;ently add a convenient
  proportion of Rectifi'd <i>Aqua Fortis</i> (for the number of drops is
  hard to determine, becau&#383;e of the Differing Strength of the liquor,
  but ea&#383;ily found by tryal) the Whitene&#383;s will pre&#383;ently
  di&#383;appear, and the whole mixture become Tran&#383;parent, which you
  may, if you plea&#383;e, again reduce to a good degree of Whitene&#383;s
  (though inferiour to the fir&#383;t) onely by a more copious
  affu&#383;ion of fre&#383;h Spirit of Urine. <i>N</i>. Fir&#383;t, That
  it is not &#383;o nece&#383;&#383;ary to employ either <i>Aqua Fortis</i>
  or Spirit of Urine about this Experiment, but that we have made it with
  other liquors in&#383;tead of the&#383;e, of which perhaps more
  el&#383;ewhere. Secondly, That this Experiment, though not made with the
  &#383;ame <i>Men&#383;truums</i>, nor producing the &#383;ame Colour is
  yet much of Kin to that other to be <!-- Page 135 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135"></a>[pg 135]</span> mentioned in this
  Tract among our other Experiments of Colours, about turning a Solution of
  Præcipitate into an Orange-colour, and the Chymical Rea&#383;on being
  much alike in both, the annexing it to one of them may &#383;uffice FOR
  both.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT II.</i></h3>

  <p>Make a &#383;trong Infu&#383;ion of broken Galls in Fair Water, and
  having Filtred it into a clean Vial, add more of the &#383;ame liquor to
  it, till you have made it &#383;omewhat Tran&#383;parent, and
  &#383;ufficiently diluted the Colour, for the credit of the Experiment,
  le&#383;t otherwi&#383;e the Darkne&#383;s of the liquor might make it be
  objected, that 'twas already almo&#383;t Ink; Into this Infu&#383;ion
  &#383;hake a convenient quantity of a Cleer, but very &#383;trong
  Solution of Vitriol, and you &#383;hall immediately &#383;ee the mixture
  turn Black almo&#383;t like Ink, and &#383;uch a way of producing
  Blackne&#383;s is vulgar enough; but if pre&#383;ently after you doe upon
  this mixture drop a &#383;mall quantity of good oyl of Vitriol, and, by
  &#383;haking the Vial di&#383;per&#383;e it nimbly through the two other
  liquors, you &#383;hall (if you perform your part well, and have employ'd
  oyl of Vitriol Cleer and Strong enough) &#383;ee the Darkne&#383;s of the
  liquor pre&#383;ently begin <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_136"></a>[pg 136]</span> to be di&#383;cu&#383;s'd, and grow
  pretty Cleer and Tran&#383;parent, lo&#383;ing its Inky Blackne&#383;s,
  which you may again re&#383;tore to it by the affu&#383;ion of a
  &#383;mall quantity of a very &#383;trong Solution of Salt of Tartar. And
  though neither of the&#383;e Atramentous liquors will &#383;eem other
  than very Pale Ink, if you write with a clean Pen dipt in them, yet that
  is common to them with &#383;ome &#383;orts of Ink that prove very good
  when Dry, as I have al&#383;o found, that when I made the&#383;e
  carefully, what I wrote with either of them, e&#383;pecially with the
  Former, would when throughly Dry grow Black enough not to appear bad Ink.
  This Experiment of taking away and re&#383;toring Blackne&#383;s from and
  to the liquors, we have likewi&#383;e tryed in Common Ink; but there it
  &#383;ucceeds not &#383;o well, and but very &#383;lowly, by rea&#383;on
  that the Gum wont to be employed in the making it, does by its Tenacity
  oppo&#383;e the operations of the above mention'd Saline liquors. But to
  con&#383;ider Gum no more, what &#383;ome kind of Præcipitation may have
  to do in the producing and de&#383;troying of Inks without it, I have
  el&#383;ewhere given you &#383;ome occa&#383;ion and
  a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance to enquire; But I mu&#383;t not now &#383;tay
  to do &#383;o my &#383;elf, only I &#383;hall take notice to you, that
  though it be taken for granted that bodies will not be Præcipitated by
  Alcalizat Salts, <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_137"></a>[pg 137]</span> that have not fir&#383;t been
  di&#383;&#383;olved in &#383;ome Acid <i>Men&#383;truums</i>, yet I have
  found upon tryals, which my conjectures lead me to make on purpo&#383;e,
  That divers Vegetables <i>barely infus'd</i>, or, <i>but &#383;lightly
  decocted in common water</i>, would, upon the affu&#383;ion of a Strong
  and Cleer <i>Lixivium</i> of Pota&#383;hes, and much more of &#383;ome
  other Præcipitating liquors that I &#383;ometimes employ, afford good
  &#383;tore of a Crudled matter, &#383;uch as I have had in the
  Præcipitations of Vegetable &#383;ub&#383;tances, by the intervention of
  Acid things, and that this matter was ea&#383;ily &#383;eparable from the
  re&#383;t of the liquor, being left behind by it in the Filtre; and in
  making the fir&#383;t Ink mention'd in this Experiment, I found that I
  could by Filtration &#383;eparate pretty &#383;tore of a very Black
  pulverable &#383;ub&#383;tance, that remain'd in the Filtre, and when the
  Ink was made Cleer again by the Oyl of Vitriol, the affu&#383;ion of
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd <i>Sal Tartari</i> &#383;eem'd but to Præcipitate,
  and thereby to Unite and render Con&#383;picuous the particles of the
  Black mixture that had before been di&#383;pers'd into very Minute and
  &#383;ingly Invi&#383;ible particles by the Inci&#383;ive and
  re&#383;olving power of the highly Corro&#383;ive Oyl of Vitriol.</p>

  Galls are not &#383;o requi&#383;ite as many &#383;uppo&#383;e to the

  Experiment, We took dryed Ro&#383;e leaves and Decocted them for a while
  in Fair Water, into two or three &#383;poonfulls of this Decoction we
  &#383;hook a few drops of a &#383;trong and well filtrated Solution of
  Vitriol (which perhaps had it been Green would have done as well) and

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT III.</i></h3>

  <p>If pieces of White Harts-horn be with a competent degree of Fire
  di&#383;till'd in a Gla&#383;s-retort, they will, after the avolation of
  the Flegm, Spirit, Volatile Salt, and the loo&#383;er and lighter parts
  of the Oleagenous &#383;ub&#383;tance, remain behind of a Cole-black
  colour. And even Ivory it &#383;elf being skilfully Burnt (how I am wont
  to do it, I have el&#383;ewhere &#383;et down) affords Painters one of
  the be&#383;t and deepe&#383;t Blacks they have, and yet in the
  In&#383;tance of di&#383;till'd Harts-horn, the operation being made in
  Gla&#383;s-ve&#383;&#383;els carefully clos'd, it appears there is no
  Extraneous Black &#383;ub&#383;tance that In&#383;inuates it &#383;elf
  into White Harts-horn, and thereby makes it turn Black; but that the
  Whitene&#383;s is de&#383;troy'd, and the Blackne&#383;s generated, only
  by a Change of Texture, made in the burnt Body, by the Rece&#383;s of
  &#383;ome parts and the Tran&#383;po&#383;ition of others. And though I
  remember not that in many Di&#383;tillations of Harts-horn I ever
  &#383;ound the <i>Cap. Mort</i>. to pa&#383;s from Black to a true
  Whitene&#383;s, whil&#383;t it continu'd in Clos'd ve&#383;&#383;els, yet
  having taken out the Cole-black fragments, and Calcin'd them in Open
  ve&#383;&#383;els, I could in few hours quite de&#383;troy that
  Blackne&#383;s, &amp; without <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_139"></a>[pg 139]</span> &#383;en&#383;ibly changing their
  Bulk or Figure, reduce them to great Whitene&#383;s. So much do
  the&#383;e two Colours depend upon the Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the
  little parts, that the Bodies wherein they are to be met with do
  con&#383;i&#383;t of. And we find, that if Whitewine Tartar, or even the
  white Cry&#383;talls of &#383;uch Tartar be burnt without being truly
  Calcin'd, the <i>Cap. Mortuum</i> (as the Chymi&#383;ts call the more
  Fixt part) will be Black. But if you further continue the Calcination
  till you have perfectly Incinerated the Tartar, &amp; kept it long enough
  in a Strong fire, the remaining <i>Calx</i> will be White. And &#383;o we
  &#383;ee that not only other Vegetable &#383;ub&#383;tances, but even
  White woods, as the Hazel, will yield a Black Charcoal, and afterwards
  Whiti&#383;h a&#383;hes; And &#383;o Animal &#383;ub&#383;tances
  naturally White, as Bones and Egg&#383;hels, will grow Black upon the
  being Burnt, and White again when they are perfectly Calcin'd.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT IV.</i></h3>

  <p>But yet I much Que&#383;tion whether that Rule delivered by divers, as
  well Philo&#383;ophers as Chymi&#383;ts, <i>adu&#383;ta nigra, &#383;ed
  peru&#383;ta alba</i>, will hold as Univer&#383;ally as is pre&#383;um'd,
  &#383;ince I have &#383;everal Examples to allege again&#383;t <!-- Page
  140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140"></a>[pg 140]</span> it:
  For I have found that by burning Alabla&#383;ter, &#383;o as both to make
  it appear to boyl almo&#383;t like Milk, and to reduce it to a very fine
  Powder, it would not at all grow Black, but retain its Pure and Native
  Whitene&#383;s, and though by keeping it longer than is u&#383;ual in the
  fire, I produced but a faint Yellow, even in that part of the Powder that
  lay neare&#383;t the top of the Crucible, yet having purpo&#383;ely
  enquired of an Experienced Stone-cutter, who is Curious enough in tryng
  Conclu&#383;ions in his own Trade, he told me he had found that if
  Alaba&#383;ter or Pla&#383;ter of Paris be very long kept in a Strong
  fire, the whole heap of burnt Powder would exchange its Whitene&#383;s
  for a much deeper Colour than the Yellow I ob&#383;erv'd. Lead being
  Calcin'd with a Strong fire turns (after having purhaps run thorough
  divers other Colour) into <i>Minium</i>, who&#383;e Colour we know
  is a deep red; and if you urge this <i>Minium</i>, as I have
  purpo&#383;ely done with a Strong fire, you may much ea&#383;ier find a
  Gla&#383;&#383;ie and Brittle Body darker than <i>Minium</i>, than any
  white <i>Calx</i> or Gla&#383;s. 'Tis known among Chymi&#383;ts, that the
  white <i>Calx</i> of Antimony, by the further and more vehement operation
  of the fire, may be melted into Gla&#383;s, which we have obtain'd of a
  Red Colour, which is <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_141"></a>[pg 141]</span> far deeper than that of the
  <i>Calx</i> of Burnt Antimony, and though common Glafs of Antimony being
  u&#383;ually Adulterated with <i>Borax</i>, have its Colour thereby
  diluted, oftentimes to a very pale Yellow; yet not onely ours made more
  &#383;incerily, was, as we &#383;aid, of a Colour le&#383;s remote from
  Black, than was the <i>Calx</i>; but we ob&#383;erv'd, that by Melting it
  once or twice more, and &#383;o expo&#383;ing it to the further operation
  of the Fire, we had, as we expected, the Colour heightned. To which we
  &#383;hall add but this one In&#383;tance, (which is worth the taking
  notice of in Reference to Colours:) That, if you take Blew, but
  Un&#383;ophi&#383;ticated, Vitriol, and burn it very &#383;lowly, and
  with a Gentle degree of Heat, you may ob&#383;erve, that when it has
  Burnt but a Little, and yet &#383;o far as that you may rub it to Powder
  betwixt your fingers, it will be of a White or Whiti&#383;h Colour; But
  if you Pro&#383;ecute the Calcination, this Body which by a light
  Adu&#383;tion was made White, will pa&#383;s through other Colours, as
  Gray, Yellowi&#383;h, and Red; and if you further burn it with a Long and
  Vehement fire, by that time it comes to be <i>Peru&#383;tum</i>, it will
  be of a dark purple, nearer to Black, not only than the fir&#383;t
  <i>Calx</i>, but than the Vitriol before it at all felt the fire. I might
  add that <i>Crocus</i> <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_142"></a>[pg 142]</span> <i>Martis</i> (<i>per &#383;e</i> as
  they call it) made by the La&#383;ting violence of the Reverberated
  flames is not &#383;o near a Kin to White, as the Iron or Steel that
  afforded it was before its Calcinations; but that I &#383;uppo&#383;e,
  the&#383;e In&#383;tances may Suffice to &#383;atisfie you, that Minerals
  are to be excepted out of the forementioned Rule, which perhaps, though
  it &#383;eldome fail in &#383;ub&#383;tances belonging to the Vegetable
  or Animal Kingdome, may yet be Que&#383;tion'd even in &#383;ome of
  the&#383;e, if that be true, which the Judicious Traveller
  <i>Bellonius</i> affirms, that Charcoales made out of the Wood of
  <i>Oxycæder</i> are White; And I could not find that though in Retorts
  Hart&#383;horn and other White Bodies will be Denigrated by Heat, yet
  Camphire would not at all lo&#383;e its Whitene&#383;s, though I have
  purpo&#383;ely kept it in &#383;uch a heat, as made it melt and boyl.</p>
  <!--Erratum: delete: And to manife&#383;t, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, that

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT V.</i></h3>

  <p>And now I &#383;peak of Camphire, it puts me in mind of adding this
  Experiment, That, though as I &#383;aid in Clos'd Gla&#383;&#383;es, I
  could not Denigrate it by Heat, but it would Sublime to the &#383;ides
  and top of the Gla&#383;s, <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  will, being &#383;et on fire in the Free Air, &#383;end forth a Copious
  &#383;moak, but having purpo&#383;ely upon &#383;ome of it that was
  Flaming, clapt a Large Gla&#383;s, almo&#383;t in the form of a Hive,
  (but more Slender only) with a Hole at the top, (which I caus'd to be
  made to trye Experiments of Fire and Flame in) it continued &#383;o long
  burning that it Lin'd all the In&#383;ide of the Gla&#383;s with a Soot

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT VI</i></h3>

  <p>And this al&#383;o brings into my mind another Experiment that I made
  about the production of Blackne&#383;s, whereof, for Rea&#383;ons too
  long to be here deduced, I expected and found a good Succe&#383;s, an it
  was this: I took Rectifi'd Oyl of Vitriol (that I might have the Liquor
  Clean as well as Strong) and by degrees mixt with it a convenient
  proportion of the E&#383;&#383;ential Oyl, as Chymi&#383;ts call it, of
  Wormwood, drawn over with &#383;tore of Water in a Limbec, and warily
  Di&#383;tilling the mixture in a Retort, there remain'd <!-- Page 145
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145"></a>[pg 145]</span> a
  &#383;carce credible quantity of dry Matter<!-- Erratum: delete: s-->,
  Black as a Coal. And becau&#383;e the Oyl of Wormwood, though a
  Chymical Oyl drawn by a <i>Virtuo&#383;o</i>, &#383;eem'd to have
  &#383;omewhat in it of the Colour of the Plant, I Sub&#383;tituted in its
  Room, the Pure and Subtile E&#383;&#383;ential Oyl of Winter-Savory, and
  mixing little by little this Liquor, with (if I mis-remember not) an
  Equal weight of the formerly mention'd Rectifi'd Oyl of Vitriol, and
  Di&#383;tilling them as before in a Retort, be&#383;ides what there
  pa&#383;s'd over into the Receiver, even the&#383;e two clear Liquors
  left me a Con&#383;iderable Proportion, (though not &#383;o great as the

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT VII.</i></h3>

  <p>A way of Whiting Wax Cheaply and in Great Quantity may be a thing of

  Practice of Trades-men that Blanch it; But here Treating of
  Whitene&#383;s only in Order to the Philo&#383;ophy of Colours, I
  &#383;hall not Examine which of the Slow wayes may be be&#383;t Employ'd,
  to free Wax from the Yellow Melleous parts, but &#383;hall rather
  &#383;et down a Quick <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_146"></a>[pg 146]</span> way of making it White, though but in
  very Small Quantities. Take then a little Yellow Wax, &#383;craped or
  thinly &#383;liced, and putting it into a <!--Erratum: was C...-->Bolts-head
  or &#383;ome other Convenient Gla&#383;s, pour to it
  a pretty deal of Spirit of Wine, and placing the Ve&#383;&#383;el in Warm
  Sand, Encrea&#383;e the Heat by degrees, till the Spirit of Wine begin to
  Simper or to Boyl a little; and continuing that degree of Fire, if you
  have put Liquor enough, you will quickly have the Wax
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd, then taking it off the fire, you may either
  &#383;uffer it to Cool as ha&#383;tily as with Safety to the Gla&#383;s
  you can, or Pour it whil&#383;t 'tis yet Hot into a Filtre of Paper, and
  either in the Gla&#383;s where it Cools, or in the Filtre, you will
  &#383;oon find the Wax and <i>Men&#383;truum</i> together reduc'd into a
  White Sub&#383;tance, almo&#383;t like Butter, which by letting the
  Spirit Exhale will &#383;hrink into a much Le&#383;&#383;er Bulk, but
  &#383;till retaining its Whitene&#383;s. And that which is pretty in the
  working of this Magi&#383;tery of Wax, is, that the Yellowne&#383;s
  vani&#383;hes, neither appearing in the Spirit of Wine that
  pa&#383;&#383;es Limpid through the Filtre, nor in the Butter of Wax, if
  I may &#383;o call it, that, as I &#383;aid, is White. <!-- Page 147

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT VIII.</i></h3>

  <p>There is an Experiment, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, which though I do not
  &#383;o exactly remember, and though it be &#383;omewhat Nice to make,
  yet I am willing to Acquaint You with, becau&#383;e the thing Produc'd,
  though it be but a Curio&#383;ity, is wont not a little to plea&#383;e
  the Beholders, and it is a way of turning by the help of a Dry
  Sub&#383;tance, an almo&#383;t Golden-Colour'd Concrete, into a White
  one, the Several Tryals are not at pre&#383;ent &#383;o fre&#383;h in my
  Memory to enable me to tell you Certainly, whether an Equal onely or a
  Double weight of Common Sublimate mu&#383;t be taken in reference to the
  Tingla&#383;s, but if I mi&#383;take not, there was in the Experiment
  that &#383;ucceeded be&#383;t, Two parts of the Former taken to One of
  the Latter. The&#383;e Ingredients being finely Powdred and Exactly
  mix'd, we Sublim'd together by degrees of fire (the due Gradation of
  which is in this Experiment a thing of main Importance) there
  a&#383;cended a matter of a very peculiar Texture, for it was for the
  mo&#383;t part made up of very Thin, Smooth, Soft and Slippery Plates,
  almo&#383;t like the fine&#383;t &#383;ort of the Scales of Fi&#383;hes,
  but of &#383;o Lovely a White Inclining to <!-- Page 148 --><span

  of &#383;o Curious and Shining a Glo&#383;s, that they appear'd in
  &#383;ome re&#383;pect little Inferiour to Orient Pearls, and in other
  Regards, they &#383;eem'd to Surpa&#383;s them, and were Applauded for a
  &#383;ort of the Prettie&#383;t Trifles that we had ever prepar'd to
  Amu&#383;e the Eye. I will not undertake that though you'l hardly
  mi&#383;s changing the Colour of your &#383;hining Tingla&#383;s, yet you
  will the fir&#383;t or perhaps the &#383;econd time hit Right upon the
  way of making the Gli&#383;tring Sublimate I have been mentioning.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT IX.</i></h3>

  <p>When we Di&#383;&#383;olve in <i>Aqua Fortis</i> a mixture of Gold and
  Silver melted into one Lump, it u&#383;ually happens that the Powder of
  Gold that falls to the bottom, as not being Di&#383;&#383;oluble by that
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, will not have its own Yellow, but appear of a
  Black Colour, though neither the Gold, nor the Silver, nor the <i>Aqua
  Fortis</i> did before manife&#383;t any Blackne&#383;s. And divers
  Alchymi&#383;ts, when they make Solutions of Minerals they would Examine,
  are very Glad, if they &#383;ee a Black Powder Præcipitated to the
  Bottom, taking it for a Hopefull Sign, that tho&#383;e Particles are of a
  Golden Nature, <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_149"></a>[pg 149]</span> which appear in a Colour &#383;o
  ordinary to Gold parted from other Metalls by <i>Aqua Fortis</i>, that it
  is a trouble to the Refiner to Reduce the Præcipitated <i>Calx</i> to its
  Native Colour. For though, (as we have try'd,) that may be Quickly enough
  done by Fire, which will make this Gold look very Gloriou&#383;ly (as
  indeed 'tis at lea&#383;t one of the Be&#383;t wayes that is Practis'd
  for the Refining of Gold,) yet it requires both Watchfulne&#383;s and
  Skill, to give it &#383;uch a Degree of Fire as will &#383;erve to
  Re&#383;tore it to its Lu&#383;tre, without giving it &#383;uch a One, as
  may bring it to Fu&#383;ion, to which the Minutene&#383;s of the
  <i>Corpu&#383;eles</i> it con&#383;i&#383;ts of makes the Powder very
  apt. And this brings into my Mind, that having taken a Flat and Bright
  piece of Gold, that was Refin'd by a Curious and Skilfull Per&#383;on on
  purpo&#383;e to Trye to what height of Purity Gold could be brought by
  Art, I found that this very piece, as Glorious as it look'd, being rubb'd
  a little upon a piece of fine clean Linnen, did &#383;ully it with a kind
  of Black; and the like I have ob&#383;erv'd in Refin'd Silver, which I
  therefore mention, becau&#383;e I formerly &#383;u&#383;pected that the
  Impurity of the Metall might have been the only Cau&#383;e of what I have
  divers times obferv'd in wearing Silver-hilted Swords, Namely, that <!--
  Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150"></a>[pg 150]</span>
  where they rubb'd upon my Clothes, if they were of a Light-Colour'd
  Cloath, the Affriction would quickly Black them; and Congruou&#383;ly
  hereunto I have found Pens Blackt almo&#383;t all over, when I had a
  while carri'd them about me in a Silver Ink-ca&#383;e. To which I
  &#383;hall only add, that whereas in the&#383;e &#383;everal
  In&#383;tances of Denigration, the Metalls are worn off, or
  otherwi&#383;e Reduc'd into very Minute Parts, that Circum&#383;tance may
  prove not Unworthy your Notice.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT X.</i></h3>

  <p>That a Solution of Silver does Dye Hair of a Black Colour, is a Known
  Experiment, which &#383;ome per&#383;ons more Curious than Dextrous, have
  &#383;o Unluckily made upon them&#383;elves as to make their Friends very
  Merry. And I remember that the other day, I made my &#383;elf &#383;ome
  Sport by an Improvement of this Ob&#383;ervation, for having
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd &#383;ome Pure Silver in <i>Aqua Fortis</i>, and
  Evaporated the <i>Men&#383;truum ad &#383;iccitatem</i>, as they
  &#383;peak, I caus'd a Quantity of fair Water to be pour'd upon the
  <i>Calx</i> two or three &#383;everal times, and to be at each
  Evaporated, till the <i>Calx</i> was very Drye, and all the Greeni&#383;h
  Blewne&#383;s that is wont to appear in Common Cry&#383;tals of Silver,
  <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151"></a>[pg
  151]</span> was quite carry'd away. Then I made tho&#383;e I meant to
  Deceive, Moi&#383;ten &#383;ome part of their Skin with their own
  Spittle, and &#383;lightly Rub the moi&#383;tned parts with a little of
  this Prepar'd Silver, Whereupon they Admir'd to &#383;ee, that a
  Snow-white Body laid upon the White Skin &#383;hould pre&#383;ently
  produce a deep Blackne&#383;s, as if the &#383;tains had been made with
  Ink, e&#383;pecially con&#383;idering that this Blackne&#383;s could not,
  like that produc'd by ordinary Ink, be readily Wa&#383;h'd off, but
  requir'd many Hours, and part of it &#383;ome dayes to its Obliteration.
  And with the &#383;ame White <i>Calx</i> and a little Fair Water we
  likewi&#383;e Stain'd the White Hafts of Knives, with a la&#383;ting
  Black in tho&#383;e parts where the <i>Calx</i> was Plentifully enough
  laid on, for where it was laid on but very Thinly, the Stain was not
  quite of &#383;o Deep a Colour.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XI</i></h3>

  <p>The Cau&#383;e of the Blackne&#383;s of tho&#383;e many Nations, which
  by one common Name we are wont to call <i>Negroes</i>, has been long
  &#383;ince Di&#383;puted of by Learned Men, who po&#383;&#383;ibly had
  not done ami&#383;s, if they had al&#383;o taken into Con&#383;ideration,
  why &#383;ome whole races of other Animals be&#383;ides Men, as <!-- Page
  152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152"></a>[pg 152]</span> Foxes
  and Hares, are Di&#383;tingui&#383;h'd by a Blackne&#383;s not familiar
  to the Generality of Animals of the &#383;ame Species; The General
  Opinion (to be mention'd a little lower) has been rejected even by
  &#383;ome of the Antient Geographers, and among our Moderns
  <i>Ortelius</i> and divers other Learned Men have Que&#383;tion'd it. But
  this is no place to mention what thoughts I have had to and fro about
  the&#383;e Matters: Only as I &#383;hall freely Acknowledge, that to me
  the inquiry &#383;eems more Ab&#383;tru&#383;e than it does to many
  others, and that becau&#383;e con&#383;ulting with Authors, and with
  Books of Voyages, and with Travellers, to &#383;atisfie my &#383;elf in
  matters of Fact, I have met with &#383;ome things among them, which
  &#383;eem not to agree very well with the Notions of the mo&#383;t
  Cla&#383;&#383;ick Authors concerning the&#383;e things; for it being my
  Pre&#383;ent Work to deliver rather matters Hi&#383;torical than Theorys,
  I &#383;hall Annex Some few of my Collections, in&#383;tead of a Solemn
  Di&#383;putation. It is commonly pre&#383;um'd that the Heat of the
  Climate wherein they live, is the rea&#383;on, why &#383;o many
  Inhabitants of the Scorching Regions of <i>Africa</i> are Black; and
  there is this familiar Ob&#383;ervation to Countenance this Conjecture,
  That we plainly &#383;ee that Mowers, Reapers, and other Countrey-people,
  <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153"></a>[pg
  153]</span> who &#383;pend the mo&#383;t part of the Hot Summer dayes
  expos'd to the Sun, have the skin of their Hands and Faces, which are the
  parts immediately Expos'd to the Sun and Air, made of a Darker Colour
  than before, and con&#383;equently tending to Blackne&#383;s; And
  Contrarywi&#383;e we ob&#383;erve that the <i>Danes</i> and &#383;ome
  other people that Inhabit Cold Climates, and even the <i>Engli&#383;h</i>
  who feel not &#383;o Rigorous a Cold, have u&#383;ually Whiter faces than
  the <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>Portugalls</i> and other European Inhabitants of
  Hotter Climates. But this Argument I take to be far more Specious than
  Convincing; for though the Heat of the Sun may Darken the Colour of the
  Skin, by that Operation, which we in <i>Engli&#383;h</i> call
  Sun-burning, yet Experience doth not Evince, that I remember, That that
  Heat alone can produce a Di&#383;colouring that &#383;hall amount to a
  true Blackne&#383;s, like that of <i>Negroes</i>, and we &#383;hall
  &#383;ee by and by that even the Children of &#383;ome <i>Negroes</i> not
  yet 10. dayes Old (perhaps not &#383;o much by three quarters of that
  time) will notwith&#383;tanding their Infancy be of the &#383;ame Hue
  with their Parents. Be&#383;ides, there is this &#383;trong Argument to
  be alleg'd again&#383;t the Vulgar Opinion, that in divers places in
  <i>A&#383;ia</i> under the &#383;ame Parallel, or even of the &#383;ame
  <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154"></a>[pg
  154]</span> Degree of Latitude with the <i>African</i> Regions Inhabited
  by Blacks, the People are at mo&#383;t but Tawny;<a name="NtA_10"></a><a
  href="#Nt_10"><sup>10</sup></a> And in <i>Africa</i> it &#383;elf divers
  Nations in the Empire of <i>Ethiopia</i> are not <i>Negroes</i>, though
  Situated in the Torrid Zone, and as neer the Æquinoctial, as other
  Nations that are &#383;o (as the Black Inhabitants of <i>Zeylan</i> and
  <i>Malabar</i> are not in our Globes plac'd &#383;o near the Line as
  <i>Amara</i> the Famou&#383;e&#383;t place in <i>Ethiopia</i>.) Moreover,
  (that which is of no &#383;mall Moment in our pre&#383;ent
  Di&#383;qui&#383;ition) I find not by the be&#383;t Navigators and
  Travellers to the <i>We&#383;t-Indies</i>, who&#383;e Books or
  them&#383;elves I have con&#383;ulted on this Subject, that excepting
  perhaps one place or two of &#383;mall extent, there are any Blacks
  Originally Natives of any part of <i>America</i> (for the Blacks now
  there have been by the <i>Europeans</i> long Tran&#383;planted thither)
  though the New World contain in it &#383;o great a Variety of Climates,
  and particularly reach quite Cro&#383;s the Torri'd Zone from one Tropick
  to another. And enough it be true that the <i>Danes</i> be a Whiter
  People than the <i>Spaniards</i>, yet that may proceed rather from other
  cau&#383;es (not here to be enquired into) than from the Coldne&#383;s of
  the Climate, &#383;ince not onely the <!-- Page 155 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155"></a>[pg 155]</span> <i>Swedes</i> and
  other Inhabitants of tho&#383;e Cold Countreys, are not u&#383;ually
  &#383;o White as the <i>Danes</i>, nor Whiter than other Nations in
  proportion to their Vicinity to the Pole. [And &#383;ince the Writing of
  the former part of this E&#383;&#383;ay, having an opportunity on a
  Solemn occa&#383;ion to take Notice of the Numerous Train of Some
  Extraordinary Emba&#383;&#383;adours &#383;ent from the
  <i>Ru&#383;&#383;ian</i> Emperour to a great Monarch, ob&#383;erv'd, that
  (though it were then Winter) the Colour of their Hair and Skin was far
  le&#383;s Whiti&#383;h than the <i>Danes</i> who Inhabit a milder Region
  is wont to be, but rather for the mo&#383;t part of a Darki&#383;h Brown;
  And the Phy&#383;ician to the Emba&#383;&#383;adour with whom tho&#383;e
  <i>Ru&#383;&#383;es</i> came, being ask'd by me whether in
  <i>Mu&#383;covy</i> it &#383;elf the Generality of the People were more
  inclin'd to have Dark-colour'd Hair than Flaxen, he an&#383;wer'd
  Affirmatively; but &#383;eem'd to &#383;u&#383;pect that the True and
  Antient <i>Ru&#383;&#383;ians</i>, a Sept of whom he told me he had met
  with in one of the Provinces of that va&#383;t Empire, were rather White
  like the <i>Danes</i>, than any thing near &#383;o Brown as the
  pre&#383;ent <i>Mu&#383;covites</i> whom he gue&#383;&#383;es to be
  de&#383;cended of the <i>Tartars</i>, and to have inherited their Colour
  from them.] But to Pro&#383;ecute our former Di&#383;cour&#383;e, I
  &#383;hall add for further Proof of the Conjecture I was <!-- Page 156
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156"></a>[pg 156]</span>
  countenancing that good Authors inform us that there are <i>Negroes</i>
  in <i>Africa</i> not far from the <i>Cape of good Hope</i>, and
  con&#383;equently beyond the Southern Tropick, and without the Torrid
  Zone, much about the &#383;ame Northern Latitude (or very little more)
  wherein there are divers <i>American</i> Nations that are not
  <i>Negroes</i>, and wherein the Inhabitants of <i>Candia</i>, &#383;ome
  parts of <i>Sicily</i>, and even of <i>Spain</i> are not &#383;o much as
  Tawny-Mores. But (which is a fre&#383;h and &#383;trong Argument
  again&#383;t the common Opinion,) I find by our recent Relations of
  <i>Greenland</i> (our Accounts whereof we owe to the Curio&#383;ity of
  that Royal <i>Virtuo&#383;o</i> the pre&#383;ent King of <i>Denmark</i>,)
  that the Inhabitants are Olive-colour'd, or rather of a Darker Hiew. But
  if the Ca&#383;e were the &#383;ame with Men, and tho&#383;e other kinds
  of Animals I formerly nam'd, I &#383;hould offer &#383;omething as a
  con&#383;iderable proof, That, Cold may do much towards the making Men
  White or Black, and however I &#383;hall let down the Ob&#383;ervation as
  I have met with it, as worthy to come into the Hi&#383;tory of
  Whitene&#383;s and Blackne&#383;s, and it is, that in &#383;ome parts of
  <i>Ru&#383;&#383;ia</i> and of <i>Livonia</i> it is affirm'd by <i>Olaus
  Magnus</i> and others, that Hares and Foxes (&#383;ome add Partridges)
  which before were Black, or Red, or <!-- Page 157 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157"></a>[pg 157]</span> Gray, do in the
  depth of Winter become White by rea&#383;on of the great Cold; (for that
  it &#383;hould be, as &#383;ome conceive, by Looking upon the Snow,
  &#383;eems improbable upon divers accounts) And I remember that having
  purpo&#383;ely enquir'd of a <i>Virtuo&#383;o</i> who lately Travell'd
  through <i>Livonia</i> to <i>Mo&#383;co</i> concerning the Truth of this
  Tradition, he both told me, he believ'd it, and added, that he &#383;aw
  divers of tho&#383;e lately nam'd Animals either in
  <i>Ru&#383;&#383;ia</i> or <i>Livonia</i>, (for I do not very well
  remember whether of the two) which, though White when he &#383;aw them in
  Winter, they a&#383;&#383;ur'd him had been Black, or of other Colours
  before the Winter began, and would be &#383;o again when it was over. But
  for further &#383;atisfaction, I al&#383;o con&#383;ulted one that had
  for &#383;ome years been an Eminent Phy&#383;ician in
  <i>Ru&#383;&#383;ia</i>, who though he rejected &#383;ome other
  Traditions that are generally enough believ'd concerning that Countrey,
  told me neverthele&#383;s, that he &#383;aw no cau&#383;e to doubt of
  this Tradition of <i>Olaus Magnus</i> as to Foxes and Hares, not onely
  becau&#383;e 'tis the common and uncontroul'd A&#383;&#383;ertion of the
  Natives, but al&#383;o becau&#383;e he him&#383;elf in the Winter could
  never that he remember'd &#383;ee Foxes and Hares of any other Colour
  than White; And I my &#383;elf having &#383;een a &#383;mall White <!--
  Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158"></a>[pg 158]</span>
  Fox brought out of <i>Ru&#383;&#383;ia</i> into <i>England</i> towards
  the latter end of Winter, foretold tho&#383;e that &#383;hew'd him me,
  that he would change Colour in Summer, and accordingly coming to look
  upon him again in <i>July</i>, I found that the Back and Sides, together
  with the upper part of the Head and Tayl were already grown of a Dark
  Colour, the lower part of the Head and Belly containing as yet a
  Whitene&#383;s. Let me add, that were it not for &#383;ome &#383;cruple I
  have, I &#383;hould think more than what <i>Olaus</i> relates, confirm'd
  by the judicious <i>Olearius</i>, who was twice employ'd into tho&#383;e
  parts as a Publick Mini&#383;ter, who in his Account of
  <i>Mo&#383;covy</i> has this Pa&#383;&#383;age: <i>The Hares there are
  Gray; but in &#383;ome Provinces they grow white in the Winter</i>. And
  within &#383;ome few Lines after: <i>It is not very Difficult to find the
  Cau&#383;e of this Change, which certainly proceeds only from the Outward
  Cold, &#383;ince I know that even in Summer, Hares will change Colour, if
  they be kept a competent time in a Cellar</i>; I &#383;ay, were it not
  for Some Scruple, becau&#383;e I take notice, that in the &#383;ame Page
  the Author Affirms, that the like change of Colour that happens to Hares
  in &#383;ome Provinces of <i>Mu&#383;covy</i>, happens to them al&#383;o
  in <i>Livonia</i>, and yet immediately &#383;ubjoyns, that in
  <i>Curland</i> the Hares vary not their Colour in Winter, <!-- Page 159
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159"></a>[pg 159]</span> though
  the&#383;e two la&#383;t named Countries be contiguous, (that is)
  &#383;ever'd only by the River of <i>Dugna</i>; For it is &#383;carce
  conceivable how Cold alone &#383;hould have, in Countries &#383;o near,
  &#383;o &#383;trangely differing an operation, though no le&#383;s
  &#383;trange a thing is confe&#383;s'd by many, that a&#383;cribe the
  Complexion of <i>Negroes</i> to the Heat of the Sun, when they would have
  the River of <i>Cenega</i> &#383;o to bound the <i>Moors</i>, that though
  on the North-&#383;ide they are but Tawny, on the other &#383;ide they
  are Black.</p>

  <p>There is another Opinion concerning the Complexion of <i>Negroes</i>,
  that is not only embrac'd by many of the more Vulgar Writers, but
  likewi&#383;e by that ingenious Traveller Mr. <i>Sandys</i>, and by a
  late mo&#383;t learned Critick, be&#383;ides other men of Note, and
  the&#383;e would have the Blackne&#383;s of <i>Negroes</i> an effect of
  <i>Noah's</i> Cur&#383;e ratify'd by God's, upon <i>Cham</i>; But though
  I think that even a Naturali&#383;t may without di&#383;paragement
  believe all the Miracles atte&#383;ted by the Holy Scriptures, yet in
  this ca&#383;e to flye to a Supernatural Cau&#383;e, will, I fear, look
  like Shifting off the Difficulty, in&#383;tead of Re&#383;olving it; for
  we enquire not the Fir&#383;t and Univer&#383;al, but the Proper,
  Immediate, and Phy&#383;ical Cau&#383;e of the Jetty Colour of
  <i>Negroes</i>; And not only we do not find expre&#383;&#383;ed in the
  <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160"></a>[pg
  160]</span> Scripture, that the Cur&#383;e meant by <i>Noah</i> to
  <i>Cham</i>, was the Blackne&#383;s of his Po&#383;terity, but we do find
  plainly enough there that the Cur&#383;e was quite another thing, namely
  that he &#383;hould be a Servant of Servants, that is by an Ebrai&#383;m,
  a very Abject Servant to his Brethren, which accordingly did in part come
  to pa&#383;s, when the <i>I&#383;raelites</i> of the po&#383;terity of
  <i>Sem</i>, &#383;ubdued the <i>Canaanites</i>, that de&#383;cended from
  <i>Cham</i>, and kept them in great Subjection. Nor is it evident that
  Blackne&#383;s is a Cur&#383;e, for Navigators tell us of Black Nations,
  who think &#383;o much otherwi&#383;e of their own condition, that they
  paint the Devil White. Nor is Blackne&#383;s incon&#383;i&#383;tent with
  Beauty, which even to our European Eyes con&#383;i&#383;ts not &#383;o
  much in Colour, as an Advantageous Stature, a Comely Symmetry of the
  parts of the Body, and Good Features in the Face. So that I &#383;ee not
  why Blackne&#383;s &#383;hould be thought &#383;uch a Cur&#383;e to the
  <i>Negroes</i>, unle&#383;s perhaps it be, that being wont to go Naked in
  tho&#383;e Hot Climates, the Colour of their Skin does probably,
  according to the Doctrine above deliver'd, make the Sun-beams more
  Scorching to them, than they would prove to a people of a White
  Complexion.</p>

  <p>Greater probability there is, That the Principal Cau&#383;e (for I
  would not exclude <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_161"></a>[pg 161]</span> all concurrent ones) of the
  Blackne&#383;s of <i>Negroes</i> is &#383;ome Peculiar and Seminal
  Impre&#383;&#383;ion, for not onely we &#383;ee that <i>Blackmore</i>
  boyes brought over into the&#383;e Colder Climates lo&#383;e not their
  Colour; But good Authors inform us, That the Off-&#383;pring of
  <i>Negroes</i> Tran&#383;planted out of <i>Africa</i>, above a hundred
  years ago, retain &#383;till the Complexion of their Progenitors, though
  po&#383;&#383;ibly in Tract of time it will decay; As on the other
  &#383;ide, the White people removing into very Hot Climates, have their
  Skins by the Heat of the Sun &#383;corch'd into Dark Colours; yet neither
  they, nor their Children have been ob&#383;erv'd, even in the Countreys
  of <i>Negroes</i>, to de&#383;cend to a Colour amounting to that of the
  Natives; whereas I remember I have Read in <i>Pi&#383;os</i><a
  name="NtA_11"></a><a href="#Nt_11"><sup>11</sup></a> excellent account of
  <i>Bra&#383;ile</i>, that betwixt the <i>Americans</i> and <i>Negroes</i>
  are generated a di&#383;tinct &#383;ort of Men, which they call
  <i>Cabocles</i>, and betwixt <i>Portugalls</i> and <i>Æthiopian</i>
  women, He tells us, he has &#383;ometimes &#383;een Twins, whereof one
  had a White skin, the other a Black; not to mention here &#383;ome other
  in&#383;tances, he gives, that the productions of the mixtures of
  differing people, that is (indeed,) the effects of Seminal
  Impre&#383;&#383;ions which they <!-- Page 162 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162"></a>[pg 162]</span> con&#383;equently
  argue to have been their Cau&#383;es; and we &#383;hall not much
  &#383;cruple at this, if we con&#383;ider, that even Organical parts may
  receive great Differences from &#383;uch peculiar Impre&#383;&#383;ions,
  upon what account &#383;oever they came to be &#383;etled in the
  fir&#383;t Individual per&#383;ons, from whom they are Propogated to
  Po&#383;terity, as we &#383;ee in the Blobber-Lips and Flat-No&#383;es of
  mo&#383;t Nations of <i>Negroes</i>. And if we may Credit what Learned
  men deliver concerning the Little Feet of the <i>Chine&#383;ses</i>, the
  <i>Macrocephali</i> taken notice of by <i>Hippocrates</i>, will not be
  the only In&#383;tance we might apply to our pre&#383;ent purpo&#383;e.
  And on this occa&#383;ion it will not perchance be Impertinent to add
  &#383;omething of what I have ob&#383;erv'd in other Animals, as that
  there is a &#383;ort of Hens that want Rumps; And that (not to mention
  that in &#383;everal places there is a &#383;ort of Crows or Daws that
  are not Cole-black as ours, but partly of a Whiti&#383;h Colour) in
  &#383;pight of <i>Porphyries</i> examples of In&#383;eparable Accidents,
  I have &#383;een a perfectly White Raven, as to Bill as well as Feathers,
  which I attentively con&#383;idered, for fear of being impos'd upon. And
  this recalls into my Memory, what a very Ingenious Phy&#383;ician has
  divers times related to me of a young Lady, to whom being call'd, he
  found that though <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_163"></a>[pg 163]</span> &#383;he much complain'd of want of
  Health, yet there appear'd &#383;o little cau&#383;e either in her Body,
  or her Condition to Gue&#383;s that She did any more than fancy her
  &#383;elf Sick, that &#383;crupling to give her Phy&#383;ick, he
  per&#383;waded her Friends rather to divert her Mind by little Journeys
  of Plea&#383;ure, in one of which going to Vi&#383;it St.
  <i>Winifrids</i> Well, this Lady, who was a <i>Catholick</i>, and devout
  in her Religion, and a pretty while in the Water to perform &#383;ome
  Devotions, and had occa&#383;ion to fix her Eyes very attentively upon
  the Red pipple-&#383;tones, which in a &#383;catter'd order made up a
  good part of tho&#383;e that appear'd through the water, and a while
  after growing Bigg, &#383;he was deliver'd of a Child, who&#383;e White
  Skin was Copiou&#383;ly &#383;peckl'd with &#383;pots of the Colour and
  Bigne&#383;&#383;s of tho&#383;e Stones, and though now this Child have
  already liv'd &#383;everal years, yet &#383;he &#383;till retains them. I
  have but two things to add concerning the Blackne&#383;s of
  <i>Negroes</i>, the one is, that the Seat of that Colour &#383;eems to be
  but the thin <i>Epidermes</i>, or outward Skin, for I knew a young
  <i>Negroe</i>, who having been lightly Sick of the Small Pox or
  Mea&#383;les, (for it was doubted which of the two was his
  Di&#383;ea&#383;e) I found by enquiry of a per&#383;on that was concern'd
  for him, that in tho&#383;e places <!-- Erratum: insert -->where the
  little Tumors <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_164"></a>[pg 164]</span> <!-- Erratum: dele. that--> had
  broke their pa&#383;&#383;age through the Skin, when they were gone, they
  left Within &#383;pecks behind them; And the lately commended
  <i>Pi&#383;o</i> a&#383;&#383;ures us, that having the opportunity in
  <i>Bra&#383;il</i> to Di&#383;&#383;ect many <i>Negroes</i>, he cleerly
  found that their Blackne&#383;s went no deeper than the very outward
  Skin, which <i>Cuticula</i> or <i>Epidermis</i> <!-- Erratum: for 
  Epiderms--> being remov'd, the undermo&#383;t Skin or <i>Cutis</i>
  appear'd ju&#383;t as White as that of <i>Europæan</i> Bodyes. And the
  like has been affirmed to me by a Phy&#383;ician of our own, whom,
  hearing he had Di&#383;&#383;ectcd a <i>Negroe</i> here in
  <i>England</i>, I con&#383;ulted about this particular. The other thing
  to be here taken notice of concerning <i>Negroes</i> is, That having
  enquir'd of an Intelligent acquaintance of mine (who keeps in the
  <i>Indies</i> about 300. <!--Erratum: for 200.--> of them as well
  Women as Men to work in his Plantations,) whether their Children come
  Black into the world; he an&#383;wer'd, That they did not, but were
  brought forth of almo&#383;t the like Reddi&#383;h Colour with our
  <i>European</i> Children; and having further enquir'd, how long it was
  before the&#383;e Infants appear'd Black, be reply'd, that 'twas not wont
  to be many daies. And agreeable to this account I find that, given us in
  a fre&#383;hly publi&#383;h'd French Book written by a
  <i>Je&#383;uit</i>, that had good opportunity <!-- Page 165 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165"></a>[pg 165]</span> of Knowing the
  Truth of what he Delivers, for being one of the Mi&#383;&#383;ionaries of
  his Order into the Southern <i>America</i> upon the Laudable De&#383;ign
  of Converting Infidels to Chri&#383;tianity, he Baptiz'd &#383;everal
  Infants, which when newly Born, were much of the &#383;ame Colour with
  <i>European</i> Babes, but within about a Week began to appear of the Hue
  of their Parents. But more Pregnant is the Te&#383;timony of our
  Countrey-man <i>Andrew Battel</i>, who being &#383;ent Pri&#383;oner by
  the <i>Portugalls</i> to <i>Angola</i>, liv'd there, and in the adjoyning
  Regions, partly as a Pri&#383;oner, partly as a Pilot, and partly as a
  Souldier, near 18. years, and he mentioning the <i>African</i> Kingdom of
  <i>Longo</i>, peopl'd with Blacks, has this pa&#383;&#383;age:<a
  name="NtA_12"></a><a href="#Nt_12"><sup>12</sup></a> <i>The Children in

  grieve at</i>; And the &#383;ame per&#383;on has el&#383;ewhere a
  Relation, which, if he have made no u&#383;e at all of the <!-- Page 166
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166"></a>[pg 166]</span> liberty
  of a Traveller, is very well worth our Notice, &#383;ince this, together
  with that we have formerly mention'd of Seminal Impre&#383;&#383;ions,
  &#383;hews a po&#383;&#383;ibility, that a Race of <i>Negroes</i> might
  be begun, though none of the Sons of <i>Adam</i>, for many Precedent
  Generations were of that Complexion. For I &#383;ee not why it
  &#383;hould not be at lea&#383;t as po&#383;&#383;ible, that White
  Parents may &#383;ometimes have Black Children, as that <i>African
  Negroes</i> &#383;hould &#383;ometimes have la&#383;tingly White ones,
  e&#383;pecially &#383;ince concurrent cau&#383;es may ea&#383;ily more
  befriend the Productions of the Former kind, than under the
  &#383;corching Heat of <i>Africa</i> tho&#383;e of the Latter. And I
  remember on the occa&#383;ion of what he delivers, that of the White
  Raven formerly mention'd, the Po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;or affirm'd to
  me, that in the Ne&#383;t out of which he was taken White, they found
  with him but one other Young one, and that he was of as Jetty a Black as
  any common Raven. But let us hear our Author him&#383;elf<a

  (&#383;ayes he, &#383;peaking of the formerly mention'd Regions) <i>Born

  go to the Market they may take what they lift, for all Men &#383;tand in

  Countrey in our Globes is plac'd almo&#383;t in the mid&#383;t of the
  Torrid Zone (four or five Degrees Southward of the Line.) And our Author
  el&#383;ewhere tells us of the Inhabitants, that they are &#383;o fond of
  their Blackne&#383;s, that they will not &#383;uffer any that is not of
  that Colour (as the <i>Portugalls</i> that come to Trade thither) to be
  &#383;o much as Buri'd in their Land, of which he annexes a particular
  example,<a name="NtA_14"></a><a href="#Nt_14"><sup>14</sup></a> that may
  be &#383;een in his Voyage pre&#383;erv'd by our Indu&#383;trious
  Countreyman Mr. <i>Purchas</i>. But it is high time for me to
  di&#383;mi&#383;s Ob&#383;ervations, and go on with Experiments.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XII.</i></h3>

  <p>The way, <i>Pyrophilus,</i> of producing Whitene&#383;s by Chymical
  Præcipitations is very well worth our ob&#383;erving, for thereby Bodyes
  of very Differing Colours as well as Natures, though di&#383;&#383;olv'd
  in Several Liquors, <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_168"></a>[pg 168]</span> are all brought into <i>Calces</i> or
  Powders that are White. Thus we find that not only Crabs-eyes, that are
  of them&#383;elves White, and Pearls that are almo&#383;t &#383;o, but
  <i>Coral</i> and <i>Minium</i> that are Red, being di&#383;&#383;olv'd in
  Spirit of Vinegar, may be uniformly Præcipitated by Oyl of <i>Tartar</i>
  into White Powders. Thus Silver and Tin &#383;eparately
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd in <i>Aqua Fortis</i>, will the one Præcipitate it
  &#383;elf, and the other be Præcipitated by common Salt-water into a
  White <i>Calx</i>, and &#383;o will Crude Lead and Quick&#383;ilver
  fir&#383;t di&#383;&#383;olv'd likewi&#383;e in <i>Aqua Fortis</i>. The
  like <i>Calx</i> will be afforded as I have try'd by a Solution of that
  &#383;hining Mineral Tingla&#383;s di&#383;&#383;olv'd in <i>Aqua
  Fortis</i>, and Præcipitated out of it; and divers of the&#383;e
  <i>Calces</i> may be made at lea&#383;t as Fair and White, if not better
  Colour'd, if in&#383;tead of Oyl of <i>Tartar</i> they were Præcipitated
  with Oyl of <i>Vitriol</i>, or with another Liquor I could Name. Nay,
  that Black Mineral <i>Antimony</i> it &#383;elf, being reduc'd by and
  with the Salts that concurr to the Compo&#383;ition of common Sublimate,
  into that Cleer though Unctuous Liquor that Chymi&#383;ts commonly call
  Rectifi'd Butter of <i>Antimony</i>, will by the bare affu&#383;ion of
  &#383;tore of Fair Water be &#383;truck down into that Snow-white Powder,
  which when the adhering Saltne&#383;s is well wa&#383;h'd <!-- Page 169
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169"></a>[pg 169]</span> off,
  Chymi&#383;ts are pleas'd to call <i>Mercurius Vitæ</i>, though the like
  Powder may be made of <i>Antimony</i>, without the addition of any
  <i>Mercury</i> at all. And this Lacte&#383;cence if I may &#383;o call
  it, does al&#383;o commonly en&#383;ue when Spirit of Wine, being
  Impregnated with tho&#383;e parts of Gums or other Vegetable Concretions,
  that are &#383;uppos'd to abound with Sulphureous Corpu&#383;cles, fair
  Water is &#383;uddenly pour'd upon the Tincture or Solution. And I
  remember that very lately I did, for Tryal &#383;ake, on a Tincture of
  <i>Benjamin</i> drawn with Spirit of Wine, and brought to be as Red as
  Blood, pour &#383;ome fair Water, which pre&#383;ently mingling with the
  Liquor, immediately turn'd the whole Mixture White. But if &#383;uch
  Seeming Milks be &#383;uffer'd to &#383;tand un&#383;tirr'd for a
  convenient while, they are wont to let fall to the bottome a
  Re&#383;inous Sub&#383;tance, which the Spirit of Wine Diluted and
  Weakned by the Water pour'd into it <!-- Erratum: for into it-->, was
  unable to &#383;upport any longer. And &#383;omething of Kin to this
  change of Colour in Vegetables is that, which Chymi&#383;ts are wont to
  ob&#383;erve upon the pouring of Acid Spirits upon the Red Solution of
  <i>Sulphur</i>, di&#383;&#383;olv'd in an Infu&#383;ion of
  Pot-a&#383;hes, or in &#383;ome other &#383;harp <i>Lixivium</i>, the
  Præcipitated <i>Sulphur</i> before it &#383;ub&#383;ides, immediately
  turning the Red Liquor <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_170"></a>[pg 170]</span> into a White one. And other Examples
  might be added of this way of producing Whitene&#383;s in Bodyes by
  Præcipitating them out of the Liquors wherein they have been
  Di&#383;&#383;olv'd; but I think it may be more u&#383;efull to
  admoni&#383;h you, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, that this ob&#383;ervation admits
  of Re&#383;trictions, and is not &#383;o Univer&#383;al, as by this time
  perhaps you have begun to think it; For though mo&#383;t Præcipitated
  Bodyes are White, yet I know &#383;ome that are not; For Gold
  Di&#383;&#383;olv'd in <i>Aqua Regis</i>, whether you Præcipitate it with
  Oyl of <i>Tartar</i>, or with Spirit of <i>Sal Armoniack</i>, will not
  afford a White but a Yellow <i>Calx</i>. <i>Mercury</i> al&#383;o though
  reduc'd into Sublimate, and Præcipitated with Liquors abounding with
  Volatile Salts, as the Spirits drawn from Urine, Harts-horn, and other
  Animal &#383;ub&#383;tances, yet will afford, as we Noted in our
  fir&#383;t Experiment about Whitene&#383;s and Blackne&#383;s, a White
  Præcipitate, yet with <!-- Erratum for: the Solution of Pot-a&#383;hes and other Lixiviate
  Salts read:--> &#383;ome Solutions hereafter to be mentioned,
  it will let fall an Orange-Tawny Powder. And &#383;o will Crude
  <i>Antimony</i>, if, being di&#383;&#383;olv'd in a &#383;trong Lye, you
  pour (as farr as I remember) any Acid Liquor upon the Solution newly
  Filtrated, whil&#383;t it is yet Warm. And if upon the Filtrated Solution
  of <i>Vitriol</i>, you pour a Solution of <!-- Page 171 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171"></a>[pg 171]</span> one of the&#383;e
  fix'd Salts, there will &#383;ub&#383;ide a Copious &#383;ub&#383;tance,
  very farr from having any Whitene&#383;s, which the Chymi&#383;ts are
  pleas'd to call, how properly I have el&#383;ewhere examin'd, the
  <i>Sulphur of Vitriol</i>. So that mo&#383;t <!-- Erratum: insert --> part
  of Di&#383;&#383;olv'd Bodyes being by Præcipitation brought to White
  Powders, and yet &#383;ome affording Præcipitates of other Colours, the
  rea&#383;on of both the Phænomena may de&#383;erve to be enquir'd
  into.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XIII.</i></h3>

  <p>Some Learned Modern Writers<a name="NtA_15"></a><a
  href="#Nt_15"><sup>15</sup></a> are of Opinion, that the Account upon
  which Whitene&#383;s and Blackne&#383;s ought to be call'd, as they
  commonly are, the two Extreme Colours, is, That Blackne&#383;s (by which
  I pre&#383;ume is meant the Bodyes endow'd with it) receives no other
  Colours; but Whitene&#383;s very ea&#383;ily receives them all; whence
  &#383;ome of them compare Whitene&#383;s to the <i>Aristotelian Materia
  prima</i>, that being capable of any &#383;ort of Forms, as they
  &#383;uppo&#383;e White Bodyes to be of every kind of Colour. But not to
  Di&#383;pute about Names or Expre&#383;&#383;ions, the thing it &#383;elf
  that is affirm'd as Matter of Fact, &#383;eems to be True enough in
  mo&#383;t Ca&#383;es, not in all, or &#383;o, <!-- Page 172 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172"></a>[pg 172]</span> as to hold
  Univer&#383;ally. For though it be a common ob&#383;ervation among Dyers,
  That Clothes, which have once been throughly imbu'd with Black, cannot
  &#383;o well afterwards be Dy'd into Lighter Colours, the
  præexi&#383;tent Dark Colour infecting the Ingredients, that carry the
  Lighter Colour to be introduc'd, and making it degenerate into Some more
  Sad one; Yet the Experiments lately mention'd may &#383;hew us, that where
  the change of Colour in Black Bodies is attempted, not by mingling Bodyes
  of Lighter Colours with them, but by Addition of &#383;uch things as are
  proper to alter the Texture of tho&#383;e Corpu&#383;cles that contain
  the Black Colour, 'tis no &#383;uch difficult matter, as the lately
  mention'd Learned Men imagine, to alter the Colour of Black Bodyes. For
  we &#383;aw that Inks of &#383;everal Kinds might in a trice be depriv'd
  of all their Blackne&#383;s; and tho&#383;e made with Logwood and
  Red-Ro&#383;es might al&#383;o be chang'd, the one into a Red, the other
  into a Reddi&#383;h Liquor; and with Oyl of <i>Vitriol</i> I have
  &#383;ometimes turn'd Black pieces of Silk into a kind of Yellow, and
  though the Taffaty were thereby made Rotten, yet the &#383;poyling of
  that does no way prejudice the Experiment, the change of Black Silk into
  Yellow, being never the le&#383;s True, becau&#383;e <!-- Page 173
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173"></a>[pg 173]</span> the
  Yellow Silk is the le&#383;s good. And as for Whitene&#383;s, I think the
  general affirmation of its being &#383;o ea&#383;ily De&#383;troy'd or
  Tran&#383;muted by any other Colour, ought not to be receiv'd without
  &#383;ome Cautions and Re&#383;trictions. For whereas, according to what
  I formerly Noted, Lead is by Calcination turned into that Red Powder we
  call <i>Minium</i>; And Tin by Calcination reduc'd to a White
  <i>Calx</i>, the common Putty that is &#383;old and us'd &#383;o much in
  Shops, in&#383;tead of being, as it is pretended and ought to be, only
  the <i>Calx</i> of Tin, is, by the Artificers that make it, to &#383;ave
  the charge of Tin, made, (as &#383;ome, of them&#383;elves have
  confe&#383;s'd, and as I long &#383;u&#383;pected by the Cheap rate it
  may be bought for) but of half Tin and half Lead, if not far more Lead
  than Tin, and yet the Putty in &#383;pight of &#383;o much Lead is a very
  White Powder, without di&#383;clo&#383;ing any mixture of <i>Minium</i>.
  And &#383;o if you take two parts of Copper, which is a High-colour'd
  Metall, to but one of Tin, you may by Fu&#383;ion bring them into one
  Ma&#383;s, wherein the Whitene&#383;s of the Tin is much more
  Con&#383;picuous and Predominant than the Reddi&#383;hne&#383;s of the
  Copper. And on this occa&#383;ion it may not be Impertinent to mention an
  Experiment, which I relate upon the Credit of a very Hone&#383;t man,
  <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174"></a>[pg
  174]</span> whom I purpo&#383;ely enquir'd of about it, being my
  &#383;elf not very fond of making Tryals with <i>Ar&#383;enick</i>, the
  Experiment is this, That if you Colliquate <i>Ar&#383;enick</i> and
  Copper in a due proportion, the <i>Ar&#383;enick</i> will Blanch the
  Copper both within and without, which is an Experiment well enough Known;
  but when I enquir'd, whether or no this White mixture being skilfully
  kept a while upon the Cupel would not let go its <i>Ar&#383;enick</i>,
  which made Whitene&#383;s its prædominant Colour, and return to the
  Reddi&#383;hne&#383;s of Copper, I was a&#383;&#383;ur'd of the
  Affirmative; &#383;o that among Mineral Bodyes, &#383;ome of tho&#383;e
  that are White, may be far more capable, than tho&#383;e I am
  rea&#383;oning with &#383;eem to have known, of Eclip&#383;ing others,
  and of making their Colour Prædominant in Mixtures. In further
  Confirmation of which may be added, that I remember that I al&#383;o took
  a lump of Silver and Gold melted together, wherein by the Æ&#383;timate
  of a very Experienced Refiner, there might be about a fourth or third
  part of Gold, and yet the Yellow Colour of the Gold was &#383;o hid by
  the White of the Silver, that the whole Ma&#383;s appear'd to be but
  Silver, and when it was rubb'd upon the Touch&#383;tone, an ordinary
  beholder could &#383;carce have di&#383;tingui&#383;h'd it from the Touch
  of common <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_175"></a>[pg 175]</span> Silver; though if I put a little
  <i>Aqua Fortis</i> upon any part of the White Surface it had given the
  Touch&#383;tone, the Silver in the moi&#383;tned part being immediately
  taken up and conceal'd by the Liquor, the Golden Particles would
  pre&#383;ently di&#383;clo&#383;e that native Yellow, and look rather as
  if Gold, than if the above mention'd mixture, had been rubb'd upon the
  Stone.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XIV.</i></h3>

  <p>I took a piece of Black-horn, (poli&#383;h'd as being part of a Comb)
  this with a piece of broken gla&#383;s I &#383;crap'd into many thin and
  curdled flakes, &#383;ome &#383;horter and &#383;ome longer, and having
  laid a pretty Quantity of the&#383;e &#383;crapings together, I found, as
  I look'd for, that the heap they compos'd was White, and though, if I
  laid it upon a clean piece of White Paper, its Colour &#383;eem'd
  &#383;omewhat Eclips'd by the greater Whitene&#383;s of the Body it was
  compar'd with, looking &#383;omewhat like Linnen that had been
  &#383;ulli'd by a little wearing, yet if I laid it upon a very Black
  Body, as upon a Beaver Hatt, it then appear'd to be of a good White,
  which Experiment, that you may in a trice make when you plea&#383;e,
  &#383;eems very much to Disfavour both their Doctrine <!-- Page 176
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176"></a>[pg 176]</span> that
  would have Colours to flow from the Sub&#383;tantial Forms of Bodyes, and
  that of the Chymi&#383;ts al&#383;o, who a&#383;cribe them to one or
  other of their three Hypo&#383;tatical Principles; for though in our
  Ca&#383;e there was &#383;o great a Change made, that the &#383;ame Body
  without being &#383;ub&#383;tantially either Increas'd or
  Le&#383;&#383;ened, pa&#383;&#383;es immediately from one extreme Colour
  to another (and that too from Black to White) yet this &#383;o great and
  &#383;udden change is effected by a &#383;light Mechanical
  Tran&#383;po&#383;ition of parts, there being no Salt or <i>Sulphur</i>
  or <i>Mercury</i> that can be pretended to be Added or Taken away, nor
  yet any &#383;ub&#383;tantial Form that can rea&#383;onably be
  &#383;uppos'd to be Generated and De&#383;troy'd, the Effect proceeding
  only from a Local Motion of the parts which &#383;o vary'd their
  Po&#383;ition as to multiply their di&#383;tinct Surfaces, and to
  Qualifie them to Reflect far more Light to the Eye, than they could
  before they were &#383;crap'd off from the entire piece of Black
  horn.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XV.</i></h3>

  <p>And now, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, it will not be improper for us to take
  &#383;ome notice of an Opinion touching the cau&#383;e of Blackne&#383;s,
  which I judged <!-- Erratum: insert--> it not &#383;o
  &#383;ea&#383;onable to Que&#383;tion, till I <!-- Page 177 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177"></a>[pg 177]</span> I had &#383;et
  down &#383;ome of the Experiments, that might ju&#383;tifie my
  di&#383;&#383;ent from it. You know that of late divers Learned Men,
  having adopted the three Hypo&#383;tatical Principles, be&#383;ides other
  Notions of the Chymi&#383;ts, are very inclinable to reduce all Qualities
  of Bodies to one or other of tho&#383;e three Principles, and
  Particularly a&#383;&#383;ign for the cau&#383;e of Blackne&#383;s the
  Sootie &#383;team of <i>adust</i> or <i>torrifi'd Sulphur</i>. But I hope
  that what we have deliver'd above to countenance the Opinion we have
  propos'd about the Cau&#383;e of Blackne&#383;s, will &#383;o ea&#383;ily
  &#383;upply you with &#383;everal Particulars that may be made u&#383;e
  of again&#383;t this Opinion, that I &#383;hall now repre&#383;ent to You
  but two things concerning it.</p>

  <p>And Fir&#383;t it &#383;eems that the favourers of the Chymicall
  Theories might have pitcht upon &#383;ome more proper term, to
  expre&#383;s the Efficient of Blackne&#383;s than <i>Sulphur adust</i>;
  for we know that <i>common Sulphur</i>, not only when Melted, but even
  when Sublim'd, does not grow Black by &#383;uffering the Action of the
  fire, but continues and a&#383;cends Yellow, and rather more than
  le&#383;s White, than it was before its being expos'd to the fire. And if
  it be &#383;et on fire, as when we make that acid Liquor, that
  Chymi&#383;ts call <i>Oleum Sulphuris per campanam</i>, it affords <!--
  Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178"></a>[pg 178]</span>
  very little Soot, and indeed the flame yeelds &#383;o little, that it
  will &#383;carce in any degree Black a &#383;heet of White Paper, held a
  pretty while over the flame and &#383;moak of it, which is ob&#383;erved
  rather to Whiten than Infect linnen, and which does plainly make Red
  Ro&#383;es grow very Pale, but not at all Black, as far as the Smoak is
  permitted to reach the leaves. And I can &#383;hew you of a &#383;ort of
  fixt Sulphur made by an Indu&#383;trious Laborant of your acquaintance,
  who a&#383;&#383;ur'd me that he was wont to keep it for divers weeks
  together night and day in a naked and Violent fire, almo&#383;t like that
  of the Gla&#383;s-hou&#383;e, and when, to &#383;atisfie my
  Curio&#383;ity, I made him take out a lump of it, though it were glowing
  hot (and yet not melted,) it did not, when I had &#383;uffered it to
  cool, appear Black, the true Colour of it being a true Red. I know it may
  be &#383;aid, that <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> in the Opinion above recited mean
  the <i>Principle of Sulphur</i>, and not <i>common Sulphur</i> which
  receives its name, not from its being <i>all</i> perfectly of a
  Sulphureous Nature, but for that <i>plenty</i> and <i>Predominancy</i> of
  the Sulphureous Principle in it. But allowing this, 'tis ea&#383;ie to
  reply, that &#383;till according to this very Rea&#383;on, torrifi'd
  Sulphur &#383;hould afford more Blackne&#383;s, than mo&#383;t other
  concretes, <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_179"></a>[pg 179]</span> wherein that Principle is
  confe&#383;s'd to be far le&#383;s copious. Al&#383;o when I have expos'd
  Camphire to the fire in Clo&#383;e Ve&#383;&#383;els, as Inflamable, and
  con&#383;equenly (according to the Chymi&#383;ts) as Sulphureous a Body
  as it is, I could not by &#383;uch a degree of Heat, as brought it to
  Fu&#383;ion, and made it Boyl in the gla&#383;s, impre&#383;s any thing
  of Blackne&#383;s, or of any other Colour, than its own pure White, upon
  this Vegetable concrete. But what &#383;hall we &#383;ay to Spirit of
  Wine, which being made by a Chymical Analy&#383;is of the Liquor that
  affords it, and being totally Inflamable, &#383;eems to have a full right
  to the title they give it of <i>Sulphur Vegetabile</i>, &amp; yet this
  fluid Sulphur not only contracts not any degree of Blackne&#383;s by
  being often &#383;o heated, as to be made to Boyl, but when it burns away
  with an Actual flame, I have not found that it would di&#383;colour a
  piece of White Paper held over it, with any di&#383;cernable &#383;oot.
  Tin al&#383;o, that wants not, according to the Chymi&#383;ts, a
  <i>Sulphur Joviale</i>, when throughly burned by the fire into a
  <i>Calx</i>, is not Black, but eminently White. And I lately noted to you
  out of <i>Bellonius</i>, that the Charcoals of Oxy-cedar are not of the
  former of the&#383;e two Colours, but of the latter. And the Smoak of our
  Tinby coals here in <i>England</i>, has been <!-- Page 180 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180"></a>[pg 180]</span> u&#383;ually
  ob&#383;erv'd, rather to Blanch linnen then to Black it. To all which,
  other Particulars of the like nature might be added, but I rather
  choo&#383;e to put you in mind of the third Experiment, about making
  Black Liquors, or Inks, of Bodies that were non of them Black before. For
  how can it be &#383;aid, that when tho&#383;e Liquors are put together
  actually Cold, and continue &#383;o after their mixture, there intervenes
  any new <i>Adustion of Sulphur</i> to produce the emergent
  Blackne&#383;s? (and the &#383;ame que&#383;tion will be appliable to the
  Blackne&#383;s produc'd upon the blade of a Knife, that has cut Lemmons
  and &#383;ome kind of Sowr apples, if the juyce (though both Actually and
  Potentially Cold) be not quickly wip'd of) And when by the
  in&#383;tilling either of a few drops of Oyl of Vitriol as in the
  &#383;econd Experiment, or of a little of the Liquor mention'd in the
  Pa&#383;&#383;age pointed at in the fourth Experiment, (where I teach at
  once to De&#383;troy one black Ink, and make another) the Blackne&#383;s
  produc'd by tho&#383;e Experiments is pre&#383;ently de&#383;troy'd; if
  the Colour proceeded only from the Plenty of Sulphurous parts, torrify'd
  in the Black Bodies, I demand, what becomes of them, when the Colour
  &#383;o &#383;uddenly di&#383;&#383;appears? For it cannot
  Rea&#383;onably be &#383;aid, that all tho&#383;e that <!-- Page 181
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181"></a>[pg 181]</span>
  &#383;uffic'd to make &#383;o great a quantity of Black Matter,
  &#383;hould re&#383;ort to &#383;o very &#383;mall a proportion of the
  Clarifying Liquor, (if I may &#383;o call it) as to be deluted by it,
  with out at all Denigrating it. And if it be &#383;aid that the
  In&#383;till'd Liquor di&#383;pers'd tho&#383;e Black Corpu&#383;cles, I
  demand, how that Di&#383;per&#383;ion comes to de&#383;troy their
  Blackne&#383;s, but by making &#383;uch a Local Motion of their parts, as
  de&#383;troys their former Texture? which may be a Matter of &#383;uch
  moment in ca&#383;es like ours, that I remember that I have in few
  houres, without addition, from Soot it &#383;elf, attain'd pretty
  &#383;tore of Cry&#383;talline Salt, and good &#383;tore of
  Tran&#383;parent Liquor, and (which I have on another occa&#383;ion noted
  as remarkable) this &#383;o Black Sub&#383;tance had its Colour &#383;o
  alter'd, by the change of Texture it receiv'd from the fire, wherewith it
  was di&#383;till'd, that it did for a great while afford &#383;uch plenty
  of very white Exhalations, that the Receiver, though large, &#383;eem'd
  to be almo&#383;t fill'd with Milk.</p>

  <p>Secondly, But were it granted, as it is in &#383;ome ca&#383;es not
  Improbable, that divers Bodies may receive a Blackne&#383;s from a Sootie
  Exhalation, occa&#383;ion'd by the Adu&#383;tion of their Sulphur, which
  (for the Rea&#383;ons lately mention'd I &#383;hould rather call their
  Oyly parts;) yet &#383;till this account <!-- Page 182 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182"></a>[pg 182]</span> is applicable but
  to &#383;ome Particular Bodies, and will afford us no General Theory of
  Blackne&#383;s. For if, for example, White Harts-horn, being, in
  Ve&#383;&#383;els well luted to each other, expos'd to the fire, be
  &#383;aid to turn Black by the Infection of its own Smoak, I think I may
  ju&#383;tly demand, what it is that makes the Smoak or Soot it &#383;elf
  Black, &#383;ince no Such Colour, but its contrary, appear'd before in
  the Harts-horn? And with the &#383;ame Rea&#383;on, when we are told,
  that torrify'd Sulphur makes bodies Black, I de&#383;ire to be told
  al&#383;o, why Torrefaction makes Sulphur it &#383;elf Black? nor will
  there be any Satisfactory Rea&#383;on a&#383;&#383;ign'd of the&#383;e
  Quæries, without taking in tho&#383;e Fertile as well as intelligible
  Mechanical Principles of the Po&#383;ition and Texture of the Minute
  parts of the body in reference to the Light and the Eye; and the&#383;e
  applicable Principles may Serve the turn in many ca&#383;es, where the
  Adu&#383;tion of Sulphur cannot be pretended; as in the appearing
  Blackne&#383;s of an Open window, lookt upon at a &#383;omewhat remote
  di&#383;tance from the hou&#383;e, as al&#383;o in the Blackne&#383;s Men
  think they &#383;ee in the Holes that happen to be in White linnen, or
  Paper of the like Colour; and in the Increa&#383;ing Blackne&#383;s
  immediatly Produc'd barely by &#383;o rubbing Velvet, <!-- Page 183
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183"></a>[pg 183]</span>
  who&#383;e Piles were Inclin'd before, as to reduce them to a more
  Erected po&#383;ture, in which and in many other ca&#383;es formerly
  alleg'd, there appears nothing requi&#383;ite to the Production of
  <i>the</i> Blackne&#383;s, but the hindering of the incident Beams of
  Light from rebounding plentifully enough to the Eye. To be &#383;hort,
  tho&#383;e I rea&#383;on with, do concerning Blackne&#383;s, what the
  Chymi&#383;ts are wont al&#383;o to do concerning other Qualities, namely
  to content them&#383;elves to tell us, in what Ingredient of a Mixt Body,
  the Quality enquir'd after, does re&#383;ide, in&#383;tead of explicating
  the Nature of it, which (to borrow a compari&#383;on from their own
  Laboratories) is much as if in an enquiry after the cau&#383;e of
  Salivation, they &#383;hould think it enough to tell us, that the
  &#383;everal Kinds of Præcipitates of Gold and <i>Mercury</i>) as
  likewi&#383;e of Quick-&#383;ilver and Silver (for I know that make and
  u&#383;e of &#383;uch Precipitates al&#383;o) do Salivate upon the
  account of the <i>Mercury</i>, which though Di&#383;guis'd abounds in
  them, whereas the Difficulty is as much to know upon what account
  <i>Mercury</i> it &#383;elf, rather than other Bodies, has that power of
  working by Salivation. Which I &#383;ay not, as though it were not
  <i>&#383;omething</i> (and too often the mo&#383;t we can arrive at) to
  di&#383;cover in which of the <!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_184"></a>[pg 184]</span> Ingredients of a Compounded Body, the
  Quality, who&#383;e Nature is &#383;ought, re&#383;ides, but
  becau&#383;e, though this Di&#383;covery it &#383;elf may pa&#383;s for
  <i>&#383;omething</i>, and is oftentimes more than what is taught us
  about the &#383;ame &#383;ubjects in the Schools, yet we ought not to
  think it <i>enough</i>, when more Clear and Particular accounts are to be
  had.</p>

<h3>EXPERIMENT I.</h3>

  <p><img width="80" height="80" align="left" src="images/224b.png" alt="Illuminated B in Because" />
  Ecau&#383;e that, according to the Conjectures I have above propos'd,
  one of the mo&#383;t General Cau&#383;es of the Diver&#383;ity of Colours
  in Opacous Bodyes, is, that &#383;ome reflect the Light mingl'd with
  more, others with le&#383;s of Shade (either <!-- Page 186 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186"></a>[pg 186]</span> as to Quantity, or
  as to Interruption) I hold it not unfit to mention in the fir&#383;t
  place, the Experiments that I thought upon to examine this Conjecture.
  And though coming to tran&#383;cribe them out of &#383;ome
  Phy&#383;iological <i>Adver&#383;aria</i> I had written in loo&#383;e
  Papers, I cannot find one of the chief Records I had of my Tryals of this
  Nature, yet the Papers that &#383;cap'd mi&#383;carrying, will, I
  pre&#383;ume, &#383;uffice to manife&#383;t the main thing for which I
  now allege them; I find then Among my <i>Adver&#383;aria</i>, the
  following Narrative.</p>

  <p><i>October</i> the 11. About ten in the Morning in Sun-&#383;hiny
  Weather, (but not without fleeting Clouds) we took &#383;everal
  &#383;orts of Paper Stain'd, &#383;ome of one Colour, and &#383;ome of
  another; and in a Darken'd Room who&#383;e Window look'd Southward, we
  ca&#383;t the Beams that came in at a hole about three Inches and a half
  in Diameter, upon a White wall that was plac'd on one &#383;ide, about
  five foot di&#383;tance from them.</p>

  <p>The White gave much the Brighte&#383;t Reflection.</p>

  <p>The Green, Red, and Blew being Compar'd together, the Red gave much
  the &#383;tronge&#383;t Reflection, and manife&#383;tly enough al&#383;o
  threw its <i>Colour</i> upon the Wall; The Green and Blew were
  &#383;carce Di&#383;cernable <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_187"></a>[pg 187]</span> by their Colours, and &#383;eem'd to
  reflect an almo&#383;t Equal Light.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Compar'd with the two la&#383;t nam'd, Reflected
  &#383;omewhat more Light.</p>

  <p>The Red and Purple being Compar'd together, the former manife&#383;tly
  Reflected a good deal more Light.</p>

  <p>The Blew and Purple Compar'd together, the former &#383;eem'd to
  Reflect a little more Light, though the Purple Colour were more
  manife&#383;tly &#383;een.</p>

  <p>A Sheet of very well fleck'd Marbl'd Paper being Apply'd as the
  others, did not ca&#383;t any or its Di&#383;tinct Colours upon the Wall;
  nor throw its Light upon it with an Equal Diffu&#383;ion, but threw the
  Beams Un&#383;tain'd and Bright to this and that part of the Wall, as if
  it's Poli&#383;h had given it the Nature of a &#383;pecular Body. But
  comparing it with a &#383;heet of White Paper, we found the Reflection of
  the latter to be much Stronger, it diffu&#383;ing almo&#383;t as much
  Light to a <i>good Extent</i> as the Marble Paper did to <i>one part</i>
  of the Wall.</p>

  <p>The Green and Purple left us &#383;omewhat in &#383;u&#383;pence which
  Reflected the mo&#383;t Light; only the Purple &#383;eem'd to have
  &#383;ome little Advantage over the Green, which was Dark in its
  kind.</p>

  <p>Thus much I find in our above mention'd <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188"></a>[pg 188]</span>
  <i>Collections</i>, among which there are al&#383;o &#383;ome Notes
  concerning the Production of <i>Compounded Colours</i>, <i>by
  Reflection</i> from Bodyes differingly Colour'd. And the&#383;e Notes we
  intended &#383;hould &#383;upply us with what we &#383;hould mention as
  our &#383;econd Experiment: but having lo&#383;t the Paper that contain'd
  the Particulars, and remembring onely in General, that if the Objects
  which Reflected the Light were not Strongly Colour'd and &#383;omewhat
  Glo&#383;&#383;y, the Reflected Beams would not manife&#383;tly make a
  Compounded Colour upon the Wall, and even then but very Faintly, we
  &#383;hall now &#383;ay no more of that Matter, only re&#383;erving our
  &#383;elves to mention hereafter the Compo&#383;ition of a Green, which
  we &#383;till retain in Memory.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT II.</i></h3>

  <p>We may add, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, on this Occa&#383;ion, that though a
  Darken'd Room be Generally thought requi&#383;ite to make the Colour of a
  Body appear by Reflection from another Body, that is not one of
  tho&#383;e that are commonly agreed upon to be Specular (as Poli&#383;h'd
  Metall, Quick &#383;ilver, Gla&#383;s, Water, &amp;c.) Yet I have often
  ob&#383;erv'd that when I wore Doublets Lin'd with &#383;ome &#383;ilken
  <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189"></a>[pg
  189]</span> Stuff that was very Glo&#383;&#383;y and Vividly Colour'd,
  e&#383;pecially Red, I could in an Inlightned Room plainly enough
  Di&#383;cern the Colour, upon the Pure White Linnen that came out at my
  Sleeve and reach'd to my Cufs; as if that Fine White Body were more
  Specular, than Colour'd and Unpoli&#383;h'd Bodyes are thought Capable of
  being.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT III.</i></h3>

  <p>Whil&#383;t we were making the newly mention'd Experiments, we thought
  fit to try al&#383;o what Compo&#383;ition of Colours might be made by
  Altering the Light in its Pa&#383;&#383;age to the Eye by the
  Interpo&#383;ition not of Perfectly Diaphanous Bodies, (that having been
  already try'd by others as well as by us (as we &#383;hall &#383;oon have
  occa&#383;ion to take notice) but of Semi-opacous Bodyes, and tho&#383;e
  &#383;uch as look'd upon in an ordinary Light, and not held betwixt it
  and the Eye, are not wont to be Di&#383;criminated from the re&#383;t of
  Opacous Bodyes; of this Tryal, our mention'd <i>Adver&#383;aria</i>
  pre&#383;ent us the following Account.</p>

  <p>Holding the&#383;e Sheets, &#383;ometimes one &#383;ometimes the other
  of them, before the Hole betwixt the Sun and the Eye, with <!-- Page 190
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190"></a>[pg 190]</span> the
  Colour'd &#383;ides obverted to the Sun; we found them <i>&#383;ingle</i>
  to be &#383;omewhat Tran&#383;parent, and appear of the &#383;ame Colour
  as before, onely a little alter'd by the great Light they were plac'd in;
  but laying <i>two</i> of them one over another and applying them &#383;o
  to the Hole, the Colours were compounded as follows.</p>

  <p>The Blew and Yellow &#383;carce exhibited any thing but a Darker
  Yellow, which we a&#383;crib'd to the Coar&#383;ene&#383;s of the Blew
  Papers, and its Darkne&#383;s in its Kind. For applying the Blew parts of
  the Marbl'd Paper with the Yellow Paper after the &#383;ame manner, they
  exhibited a good Green.</p>

  <p>The Yellow and Red look'd upon together gave us but a Dark Red,
  &#383;omewhat (and but a little,) inclining to an Orange Colour.</p>

  <p>The Purple and Red look'd on together appear'd more Scarlet.</p>

  <p>The Purple and Yellow made an Orange.</p>

  <p>The Green and Red made a Dark Orange Tawny.</p>

  <p>The Green and Purple made the Purple appear more Dirty.</p>

  <p>The Blew and Purple made the Purple more Lovely, and far more
  Deep.</p>

  <p>The Red parts of the Marbl'd Paper look'd upon with the Yellow
  appear'd of a <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_191"></a>[pg 191]</span> Red far more like Scarlet than
  without it.</p>

  <p>But the Finene&#383;s or Coar&#383;ene&#383;s of the Papers, their
  being carefully or &#383;lightly Colour'd, and divers other
  Circum&#383;tances, may &#383;o vary the Events of &#383;uch Experiments
  as the&#383;e, that if, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, you would Build much on them,
  you mu&#383;t carefully Repeat them.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT IV.</i></h3>

  <p>The Triangular Pri&#383;matical Gla&#383;s being the In&#383;trument
  upon who&#383;e Effects we may the mo&#383;t Commodiou&#383;ly
  &#383;peculate the Nature of Emphatical Colours, (and perhaps that of
  Others too;) we thought it might be u&#383;efull to ob&#383;erve the
  &#383;everal Reflections and Refractions which the Incident Beams of
  Light &#383;uffer in Rebounding from it, and Pa&#383;&#383;ing through
  it. And this we thought might be Be&#383;t done, not (as is u&#383;ual,)
  in an ordinary Inlightn'd Room, where (by rea&#383;on of the Difficulty
  of doing otherwi&#383;e) ev'n the Curious have left Particulars Unheeded,
  which may in a convenient place be ea&#383;ily taken notice of; but in a
  Darken'd Room, where by placing the Gla&#383;s in a convenient
  Po&#383;ture, the Various Reflections and Refractions may be
  Di&#383;tinctly ob&#383;erv'd; and where it may appear <i>what</i> Beams
  are Unting'd; <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_192"></a>[pg 192]</span> and <i>which</i> they are, that upon
  the Bodyes that terminate them, do Paint either the Primary or Secondary
  Iris. In pur&#383;uance of this we did in the above mention'd Darken'd
  Room, make ob&#383;ervation of no le&#383;s than four Reflections, and
  three Refractions that were afforded us by the &#383;ame Pri&#383;m, and
  thought that notwith&#383;tanding what was taught us by the Rules of
  Catoptricks and Dioptricks, it would not be ami&#383;s to find al&#383;o,

  <p>I know not whether you will think it Incon&#383;iderable to annex to
  this Experiment, That we ob&#383;erv'd in a Room not Darken'd, that the
  Pri&#383;matical Iris (if I may &#383;o call it) might be Reflected
  without lo&#383;ing any of its &#383;everal <i>Colours</i> (for we now
  con&#383;ider not their <i>Order</i>) not onely from a plain
  Looking-gla&#383;s and from the calm Surface of Fair Water, but al&#383;o
  from a Concave Looking-gla&#383;s; and that Refraction did as little
  De&#383;troy tho&#383;e Colours as Reflection. For by the help of a large
  (double Convex) Burning-gla&#383;s through which we Refracted the Suns
  Beams, we found that one part of the Iris might be made to appear either
  beyond, or on this &#383;ide of the other Parts of the &#383;ame Iris;
  but yet the &#383;ame Vivid Colours would appear in the Di&#383;plac'd
  part (if I may &#383;o term it) as in the other. To which I &#383;hall
  add, that having, by hiding the &#383;ide of the Pri&#383;m, obverted to
  the Sun with an Opacous Body, wherein only one &#383;mall hole was left
  for the Light to pa&#383;s through, reduc'd the Pri&#383;matical Iris
  (ca&#383;t upon White Paper) into a very narrow compa&#383;s, and look'd
  upon it througn a Micro&#383;cope; the Colours appear'd the &#383;ame as
  to kind that they did to the naked Eye.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT VI.</i></h3>

  <p>It may afford matter of Speculation to the Inqui&#383;itive, &#383;uch
  as you, <i>Prophilus</i>, that as the Colours of outward Objects brought
  into a Darken'd Room, do &#383;o much depend for their Vi&#383;ibility
  upon the Dimne&#383;s of the Light they are there beheld by; that the
  ordinary Light of the day being freely let in upon them, they immediately
  di&#383;appear: &#383;o our Tryals have inform'd us, that as to the
  Pri&#383;matical Iris painted on the Floor by the beams of the Sun
  Trajected through a Triangular-gla&#383;s; though the Colours of it
  appear very Vivid ev'n at Noon-day, and in Sun &#383;hiny Weather, yet by
  a more Powerfull Light they may be made to di&#383;appear. For having
  &#383;ometimes, (in pro&#383;ecution of &#383;ome Conjectures of mine not
  now to be In&#383;i&#383;ted on,) taken a large Metalline Concave
  <i>Speculum</i>, and with it ca&#383;t the converging Beams of the Sun
  upon a Pri&#383;matical Iris which I had caus'd to be projected upon the
  Floor, I found that the over-powerfull Light made the Colours of the Iris
  di&#383;appear. And if I &#383;o Reflected the Light as that it
  cro&#383;s'd but the middle of the Iris, in that part only the Colours
  vani&#383;h'd or were made Invi&#383;ible; tho&#383;e <!-- Page 195
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195"></a>[pg 195]</span> parts of
  the Iris that were on the right and left hand of the Reflected Light
  (which &#383;eem'd to divide them, and cut the Iris a&#383;under)
  continuing to exhibit the &#383;ame Colours as before. But upon this we
  mu&#383;t not now &#383;tay to Speculate.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT VII.</i></h3>

  <p>I have &#383;ometimes thought it worth while to take notice, whether
  or no the Colours of Opacous Bodies might not appear to the Eye
  &#383;omewhat Diver&#383;ify'd, not only by the Di&#383;po&#383;ition of
  the Superficial parts of the Bodyes them&#383;elves and by the
  Po&#383;ition of the Eye in Reference to the Object and the Light, (for
  the&#383;e things are Notorious enough;) but according al&#383;o to the
  Nature of the Lucid Body that &#383;hines upon them. And I remember that
  in Pro&#383;ecution of this Curio&#383;ity, I ob&#383;erv'd a
  manife&#383;t Difference in &#383;ome Kinds of Colour'd Bodyes look'd on
  by Day-light, and afterwards by the light of the Moon; either directly
  falling on them or Reflected upon them from a Concave Looking-gla&#383;s.
  But not finding at pre&#383;ent in my Collections about Colours any thing
  &#383;et down of this Kind, I &#383;hall, till I have opportunity to
  repeat them, content my &#383;elf to add what I find Regi&#383;ter'd
  concerning <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_196"></a>[pg 196]</span> Colours look'd on by Candle-light, in
  regard that not only the Experiment is more ea&#383;ie to be repeated,
  but the Objects being the Same Sorts of Colour'd Paper la&#383;tly
  mention'd, the Collation of the two Experiments may help to make the
  Conjectures they will &#383;ugge&#383;t &#383;omewhat the le&#383;s
  uncertain.</p>

  <p>Within a few dayes of the time above mention'd, divers Sheets of
  Colour'd Paper that had been look'd upon before in the Sun&#383;hine were
  look'd upon at night by the light of a pretty big Candle, (&#383;nuff'd)
  and the Changes that were ob&#383;erv'd were the&#383;e.</p>

  <p>The Yellow &#383;eem'd much fainter than in the Day, and inclinable to
  a pale Straw Colour.</p>

  <p>The Red &#383;eem'd little Chang'd; but &#383;eem'd to Reflect Light
  more &#383;trongly than any other Colour (for White was none of
  them.)</p>

  <p>A fair Deep Green look'd upon by it &#383;elf &#383;eem'd to be a Dark
  Blew: But being look'd upon together with a Dark Blew, appear'd
  Greeni&#383;h; and beheld together with a Yellow appear'd more Blew than
  at fir&#383;t.</p>

  <p>The Blew look'd more like a Deep Purple or Murray than it had done in
  the Daylight.</p>

<!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197"></a>[pg 197]</span>
The Purple &#383;eem'd very little alter'd.

  <p>The Red look'd upon with the Yellow made the Yellow look almo&#383;t
  like Brown Cap-paper.</p>

  <p><i>N</i>. The Caution Subjoyned to the third Experiments is al&#383;o
  Applicable to this.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT VIII.</i></h3>

  <p>But here I mu&#383;t not omit to &#383;ubjoyn, that to &#383;atisfie
  our Selves, whether or no the Light of a Candle were not made
  un&#383;incere, and as it were Ting'd with a Yellow Colour by the
  Admixtion of the Corpu&#383;cles it a&#383;&#383;umes from its Fuel; we
  did not content our &#383;elves with what appears to the Naked Eye, but
  taking a pretty thick Rod or Cylinder (for thin Peeces would not
  &#383;erve the turn) of deep Blew Gla&#383;s, and looking upon the
  Candles flame at a Convenient di&#383;tance througn it, we perceiv'd as
  we expected, the Flame to look Green; which as we often note, is the
  Colour wont to emerge from the Compo&#383;ition of Opacous Bodies, which
  were apart one of them Blew, and the other Yellow. And this perchance may
  be the main Rea&#383;on of that which &#383;ome ob&#383;erve, that a
  &#383;heet of very White Paper being look'd upon by Candle light, 'tis
  not ea&#383;ie at fir&#383;t to di&#383;cern it from <!-- Page 198
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198"></a>[pg 198]</span> a light
  Yellow or Lemon Colour; White Bodyes (as we have el&#383;ewhere
  ob&#383;erv'd) having more than tho&#383;e that are otherwi&#383;e
  Colour'd, of a Specular Nature; in regard that though they exhibit not,
  (unle&#383;s they be Poli&#383;h'd,) the &#383;hape of the Luminary that
  &#383;hines on them, yet they Reflect its Light more Sincere and
  Untroubl'd, by either Shades or Refractions, than Bodyes of other Colours
  (as Blew, or Green, or Yellow or the like.)</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT IX.</i></h3>

  <p>We took a Leaf of Such Foliated Gold as Apothecaries are wont to Gild
  their Pills with; and with the Edge of a Knife, (lightly moy&#383;ten'd
  by drawing it over the Surface of the Tongue, and afterwards) laid upon
  the edge of the Gold Leaf; we &#383;o fa&#383;ten'd it to the Knife, that
  being held again&#383;t the light, it conctinu'd extended like a little
  Flagg. This Leaf being held very near the Eye, and obverted to the Light,
  appear'd &#383;o full of Pores, that it &#383;eem'd to have &#383;uch a
  kind of Tran&#383;parency as that of a Sive, or a piece of Cyprus, or a
  Love-Hood; but the Light that pa&#383;s'd by the&#383;e Pores was in its
  Pa&#383;&#383;ages So Temper'd with Shadow, and Modify'd, that the Eye
  di&#383;cern'd <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_199"></a>[pg 199]</span> no more a Golden Colour, but a
  Greeni&#383;h Blew. And for other's &#383;atisfaction, we did in the
  Night look upon a Candle through &#383;uch a Leaf of Gold; and by trying
  the Effect of Several Proportions of Di&#383;tance betwixt the Leaf, the
  Eye and the Light, we quickly hit upon &#383;uch a Po&#383;ition for the
  Leaf of Gold, as that the flame, look'd on through it, appear'd of a
  Greeni&#383;h Blew, as we have &#383;een in the Day time. The like
  Experiment try'd with a Leaf of Silver &#383;ucceeded not well.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT X.</i></h3>

  <p>We have &#383;ometimes found in the Shops of our Druggi&#383;ts, a
  certain Wood, which is there called <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>,
  becau&#383;e the Inhabitants of the Country where it grows, are wont to
  u&#383;e the Infu&#383;ion of it made in fair Water again&#383;t the
  Stone of the Kidneys, and indeed an Eminent Phy&#383;ician of our
  Acquaintance, who has very Particularly enquir'd into that
  Di&#383;ea&#383;e, a&#383;&#383;ures me, that he has found &#383;uch an
  Infu&#383;ion one of the mo&#383;t effectual Remedyes, which he has ever
  tried again&#383;t that formidable Di&#383;ea&#383;e. The anciente&#383;t
  Account I have met with of this Simple, is given us by the Experienc'd
  <i>Monardes</i> in the&#383;e Words. <!-- Page 200 --><span

  be&#383;ides the &#383;ingularity of it, may give no &#383;mall
  a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance to an attentive Con&#383;iderer towards the
  detection of the Nature of Colours. The Experiment as we made it is this.
  Take <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>, and with a Knife cut it into thin Slices,
  put about a handfull of the&#383;e Slices into two three or four pound of
  the pure&#383;t Spring-water, let them infu&#383;e there a night, but if
  you be in ha&#383;t, a much &#383;horter time may &#383;uffice;
  <i>decant</i> this Impregnated Water into a clear Gla&#383;s Vial, and if
  you hold it directly between the Light and your Eye, you &#383;hall
  &#383;ee it wholly Tincted (excepting the very top of the Liquor, wherein
  you will &#383;ome times di&#383;cern a Sky-colour'd Circle) with <!--
  Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201"></a>[pg 201]</span>
  an almo&#383;t Golden Colour, unle&#383;s your Infu&#383;ion have been
  made too Strong of the Wood, for in that ca&#383;e it will again&#383;t
  the Light appear &#383;omewhat Dark and Reddi&#383;h, and requires to be
  diluted by the addition of a convenient quantity of fair Water. But if
  you hold this Vial from the Light, &#383;o that your Eye be plac'd
  betwixt the Window and the Vial, the Liquor will appear of a deep and
  lovely Cæruleous Colour, of which al&#383;o the drops, if any be lying on
  the out&#383;ide of the Gla&#383;s, will &#383;eem to be very perfectly;
  And thus far we have try'd the Experiment, and found it to Succeed even
  by the Light of Candles of the larger &#383;ize. If you &#383;o hold the
  Vial over again&#383;t your Eyes, that it may have a Window on one
  &#383;ide of it, and a Dark part of the Room both before it and on the
  other &#383;ide, you &#383;hall &#383;ee the Liquor partly of a
  Blewi&#383;h and partly of a Golden Colour. If turning your back to the
  Window, you powr out &#383;ome of the Liquor towards the Light and
  towards your Eyes, it will &#383;eem at the comming out of the Gla&#383;s
  to be perfectly Cæruleous, but when it is fallen down a little way, the
  drops may &#383;eem Particolour'd, according as the Beams of Light do
  more or le&#383;s fully Penetrate and Illu&#383;trate them. If you take a
  Ba&#383;on about <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_202"></a>[pg 202]</span> half full of Water, and having plac'd
  it &#383;o in the Sun-beams Shining into a Room, that one part of the
  Water may be freely illu&#383;trated by the Beams of Light, and the other
  part of it Darkned by the &#383;hadow of the Brim of the Ba&#383;on, if
  then I &#383;ay you drop of our Tincture, made &#383;omewhat &#383;trong,
  both into the Shaded and Illuminated parts of the Water, you may by
  looking upon it from &#383;everal places, and by a little Agitation of
  the water, ob&#383;erve divers plea&#383;ing Phænomena which were tedious
  to particularize. If you powr a little of this Tincture upon a &#383;heet
  of White Paper, &#383;o as the Liquor may remain of &#383;ome depth upon
  it, you may perceive the Neighbouring drops to be partly of one Colour,
  and partly of the other, according to the po&#383;ition of your Eye in
  reference to the Light when it looks upon them, but if you powr off all
  the Liquor, the Paper will &#383;eem Dy'd of an almo&#383;t Yellow
  Colour. And if a &#383;heet of Paper with &#383;ome of this Liquor in it
  be plac'd in a window where the Sunbeams may &#383;hine freely on it,
  then if you turn your back to the Sun and take a Pen or &#383;ome
  &#383;uch &#383;lender Body, and hold it over-thwart betwixt the Sun and
  the Liquor, you may perceive that the Shadow projected by the Pen upon
  the Liquor, will not all of it be a vulgar <!-- Page 203 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203"></a>[pg 203]</span> and Dark, but in
  part a curiou&#383;ly Colour'd &#383;hadow, that edge of it, which is
  next the Body that makes it, being almo&#383;t of a lively Golden Colour,
  and the remoter verge of a Cæruleous one.</p>

  <p>The&#383;e and other Phænomena, which I have ob&#383;erv'd in this
  delightfull Experiment, divers of my friends have look'd upon not without
  &#383;ome wonder, and I remember an excellent Oculi&#383;t finding by
  accident in a friends Chamber a fine Vial full of this Liquor, which I
  had given that friend, and having never heard any thing of the
  Experiment, nor having any Body near him that could tell him what this
  &#383;trange Liquor might be, was a great while apprehen&#383;ive, as he
  pre&#383;ently after told me, that &#383;ome &#383;trange new
  di&#383;temper was invading his Eyes. And I confe&#383;s that the
  unu&#383;ualne&#383;s of the Phænomena made me very &#383;ollicitous to
  find out the Cau&#383;e of this Experiment, and though I am far from
  pretending to have found it, yet my enquiries have, I &#383;uppo&#383;e,
  enabled me to give &#383;uch hints, as may lead your greater
  &#383;agacity to the di&#383;covery of the Cau&#383;e of this wonder. And
  fir&#383;t finding that this Tincture, if it were too copious in the
  water, Kept the Colours from being &#383;o lively, and their Change from
  being &#383;o di&#383;cernable, and <!-- Page 204 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204"></a>[pg 204]</span> finding al&#383;o
  that the Impregnating Virtue of this Wood did by its being frequently
  Infus'd in New Water by degrees Decay, I Conjectur'd that the Tincture
  afforded by the Wood mu&#383;t proceed from &#383;ome Subtiler parts of
  it drawn forth by the Water, which &#383;wimming too and fro in it did
  &#383;o Modifie the Light, as to exhibit &#383;uch and &#383;uch Colours;
  and becau&#383;e the&#383;e Subtile parts were &#383;o ea&#383;ily
  Soluble even in Cold water, I concluded that they mu&#383;t abound with
  Salts, and perhaps contain much of the E&#383;&#383;ential Salt, as the
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> call it, of the Wood. And to try whether the&#383;e
  Subtile parts were Volatile enough to be Di&#383;till'd, without the
  Di&#383;&#383;olution of their Texture, I carefully Di&#383;till'd
  &#383;ome of the Tincted Liquor in very low Ve&#383;&#383;els, and the
  gentle heat of a Lamp Furnace; but found all that came over to be as
  Limpid and Colourle&#383;s as Rock-water, and the Liquor remaining in the
  Ve&#383;&#383;el to be &#383;o deeply Cæruleous, that it requir'd to be
  oppos'd to a very &#383;trong Light to appear of any other Colour. I took
  likewi&#383;e a Vial with Spirit of Wine, and a little Salt of
  Harts-horn, and found that there was a certain proportion to be met with
  betwixt the Liquor and the Salt, which made the Mixture fit to exhibit
  &#383;ome little Variety <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_205"></a>[pg 205]</span> of Colours not Ob&#383;ervable in
  ordinary Liquors, as it was variou&#383;ly directed in reference to the
  Light and the Eye, but this Change of Colour was very far &#383;hort from
  that which we had admir'd in our Tincture. But however, I
  &#383;u&#383;pected that the Tinging Particles did abound with &#383;uch
  Salts, who&#383;e Texture, and the Colour &#383;pringing from it, would
  probably be alter'd by peircing Acid Salts, which would in likelihood
  either make &#383;ome Di&#383;&#383;ipation of their Parts, or
  A&#383;&#383;ociate them&#383;elves to the like Bodies, and either way
  alter the Colour exhibited by them; whereupon Pouring into a &#383;mall
  Vial full of Impregnated Water, a very little Spirit of Vinegar, I found
  that according to my Expectation, the Cæruleous Colour immediately
  vani&#383;h'd, but was deceiv'd in the Expectation I had, that the Golden
  Colour would do &#383;o too; for, which way &#383;oever I turned the
  Vial, either to or from the Light, I found the Liquor to appear always of
  a Yellowi&#383;h Colour and no other: Upon this I imagin'd that the Acid
  Salts of the Vinegar having been able to deprive the Liquor of its
  Cæruleous Colour, a Sulphureous Salt being of a contrary Nature, would be
  able to Mortifie the Saline Particles of Vinegar, and De&#383;troy their
  <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206"></a>[pg
  206]</span> Effects; And accordingly having plac'd my Self betwixt the
  Window, and the Vial, and into the Same Liquor dropt a few drops of Oyl
  of Tartar <i>per Deliquium</i>, (as <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> call it) I
  ob&#383;erv'd with plea&#383;ure, that immediately upon the
  Diffu&#383;ion of this Liquor, the Impregnated Water was re&#383;tor'd to
  its former Cæruleous Colour; And this Liquor of <i>Tartar</i> being very
  Ponderous, and falling at fir&#383;t to the Bottom of the Vial, it was
  ea&#383;ie to ob&#383;erve that for a little while the Lower part of the
  Liquor appear'd deeply Cæruleous; whil&#383;t all the Upper part retain'd
  its former Yellowne&#383;s, which it immediately lo&#383;t as &#383;oon
  as either Agitation or Time had made a competent Diffu&#383;ion of the
  Liquor of <i>Tartar</i> through the Body of the former Tincture; and this
  re&#383;tored Liquor did, as it was Look'd upon again&#383;t or from the
  Light, exhibit the Same <i>Phænomena</i> as the Tincted Water did, before
  either of the Adventitious Liquors was pour'd into it.</p>

  <p>Having made, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, divers Tryals upon this Nephritick

  <i>Kircherus</i>, who having received a Cup Turned of it from the
  <i>Mexican</i> Procurator of his Society, has probably receiv'd al&#383;o

  <p>In this pa&#383;&#383;age we may take notice of the following
  Particulars. And fir&#383;t, he calls it a White <i>Mexican</i> Wood,
  whereas (not to mention that <i>Mornardes</i> informs us that it is
  brought out of <i>Nova Hi&#383;pania</i>) the Wood that we have met with
  in &#383;everal places, and employ'd as <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>, was
  not White, but for the mo&#383;t part of a much Darker Colour, not unlike
  that of the Sadder Colour'd Wood of Juniper. 'Tis true, that
  <i>Monardes</i> him&#383;elf al&#383;o &#383;ays, that the Wood is White;
  and it is affirm'd, that the Wood which is of a Sadder Colour is
  Adulterated by being Imbu'd with the Tincture of a Vegetable, in
  who&#383;e Decoction it is &#383;teep'd. But having purpo&#383;ely
  enquir'd of the Eminente&#383;t of our <i>Engli&#383;h</i>
  Druggi&#383;ts, he peremptorily deny'd it. And indeed, having
  con&#383;ider'd &#383;ome of the faire&#383;t Round pieces of this <!--
  Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209"></a>[pg 209]</span>
  Wood that I could meet with in the&#383;e Parts, I had Opportunity to
  take notice that in one or two of them it was the External part of the
  Wood that was White, and the more Inward part that was of the other
  Colour, the contrary of which would probably have appear'd, if the Wood
  had been Adulterated after the afore-mention'd manner. And I have at
  pre&#383;ent by me a piece of &#383;uch Wood, which for about an Inch
  next the Bark is White, and then as it were abruptly pa&#383;&#383;es to
  the above-mention'd Colour, and yet this Wood by the Tincture, it
  afforded us in Water, appears to have its Colour'd part Genuine enough;
  for as for the White part, it appears upon tryal of both at once, much
  le&#383;s enrich'd with the tingent Property.</p>

  <p>Next, whereas our Author tells us, that the Infu&#383;ion of this Wood
  expos'd in a Vial to the Light, looks like Spring-water, in which he
  afterwards adds, that there is no Tincture to be &#383;een in it, our
  Ob&#383;ervation and his agree not, for the Liquor, which oppo&#383;ed to
  the Darker part of a Room exhibits a Sky-colour, did con&#383;tantly,
  when held again&#383;t the Light, appear Yellowi&#383;h or Reddi&#383;h,
  according as its Tincture was more Dilute or Deep; and <!-- Page 210
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210"></a>[pg 210]</span> then,
  whereas it has been already &#383;aid, that the Cæruleous Colour was by
  Acid Salts aboli&#383;hed, this Yellowi&#383;h one &#383;urviv'd without
  any con&#383;iderable Alteration, &#383;o that unle&#383;s our Author's
  Words be taken in a very Limited Sen&#383;e, we mu&#383;t conclude, that
  either his Memory mis-inform'd him, or that his White <i>Nephritick</i>
  Wood, and the Sadder Colour'd one which we employ'd, were not altogether
  of the &#383;ame Nature: What he mentions of the Cup made of <i>Lignum
  Nephriticum</i>, we have not had Opportunity to try, not having been able
  to procure pieces of that Wood great enough, and otherwi&#383;e fit to be
  turned into Cups; but as for what he &#383;ays in the Title of his
  Experiment, that this Wood tinges the Water with all Sorts of Colours,
  that is much more than any of tho&#383;e pieces of Nephritick Wood that
  we have hitherto employ'd, was able to make good; The change of Colours
  di&#383;cernable in a Vial full of Water, Impregnated by any of them, as
  it is directed towards a place more Light&#383;ome or Ob&#383;cure, being
  far from affording a Variety an&#383;werable to &#383;o promi&#383;ing a
  Title. And as for what he tells us, that in the Dark the Infu&#383;ion of
  our Wood will re&#383;ume a Cæruleous Colour, I wi&#383;h he had Inform'd
  us how he Try'd it.</p>

<!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211"></a>[pg 211]</span>

  <p>But this brings into my mind, that having &#383;ometimes for
  Curio&#383;ity &#383;ake, brought a round Vial with a long Neck fill'd
  with the Tincture of <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i> into the Darken'd Room
  already often mention'd, and holding it &#383;ometimes in, &#383;ometimes
  near the Sun-beams that enter'd at the hole, and &#383;ometimes partly in
  them, and partly out of them, the Gla&#383;s being held in &#383;everal
  po&#383;tures, and look'd upon from &#383;everal Neighbouring parts of
  the Room, di&#383;clos'd a much greater Variety of Colours than in
  ordinary inlightn'd Rooms it is wont to do; exhibiting, be&#383;ides the
  u&#383;ual Colours, a Red in &#383;ome parts, and a Green in others,
  be&#383;ides Intermediate Colours produc'd by the differing Degrees, and
  odd mixtures of Light and Shade.</p>

  <p>By all this You may &#383;ee, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, the
  rea&#383;onablene&#383;s of what we el&#383;ewhere had occa&#383;ion to
  mention, when we have divers times told you, that it is u&#383;efull to
  have New Experiments try'd over again, though they were, at fir&#383;t,
  made by Knowing and Candid Men, &#383;uch Reiterations of Experiments
  commonly exhibiting &#383;ome New Phænomena, detecting &#383;ome
  Mi&#383;take or hinting &#383;ome Truth, in reference to them, that was
  not formerly taken notice of. And &#383;ome of our friends have been
  pleas'd to <!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_212"></a>[pg 212]</span> think, that we have made no
  unu&#383;efull addition to this Experiment, by &#383;hewing a way, how in
  a moment our Liquor may be depriv'd of its Blewne&#383;s, and
  re&#383;tor'd to it again by the affu&#383;ion of a very few drops of
  Liquors, which have neither of them any Colour at all of their own. And
  that which de&#383;erves &#383;ome particular wonder, is, that the
  Cæruleous Tincture of our Wood is &#383;ubject by the former Method to be
  De&#383;troy'd or Re&#383;tor'd, the Yellowi&#383;h or Reddi&#383;h
  Tincture continuing what it was. And that you may &#383;ee, that Salts
  are of a con&#383;iderable u&#383;e in the &#383;triking of Colours, let
  me add to the many Experiments which may be afforded us to this
  purpo&#383;e by the Dyers Trade, this Ob&#383;ervation; That as far as we
  have hitherto try'd, tho&#383;e Liquors in general that are &#383;trong
  of Acid Salts have the Power of De&#383;troying the Blewne&#383;s of the
  Infu&#383;ion of our Wood, and tho&#383;e Liquors indi&#383;criminatly
  that abound with Sulphureous Salts, (under which I comprehend the Urinous
  and Volatile Salts of Animal Sub&#383;tances, and the Alcali&#383;ate or
  fixed Salts that are made by Incineration) have the vertue of
  Re&#383;toring it.</p>

<!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213"></a>[pg 213]</span>

  <p><i>A Corollary of the Tenth Experiment.</i></p>

  <p>That this Experiment, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, may be as well U&#383;efull
  as Delightfull to You, I mu&#383;t mind You, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, that in
  the newly mention'd Ob&#383;ervation, I have hinted to You a New and
  Ea&#383;ie way of Di&#383;covering in many Liquors (for I dare not
  &#383;ay in all) whether it be an Acid or Sulphureous Salt, that is
  Predominant; and that &#383;uch a Di&#383;covery is oftentimes of great
  Difficulty, and may frequently be of great U&#383;e, he that is not a
  Stranger to the various Properties and Effects of Salts, and of how great
  moment it is to be able to di&#383;tingui&#383;h their Tribes, may
  readily conceive. But to proceed to the way of trying other Liquors by an
  Infu&#383;ion of our Wood, take it briefly thus. Suppo&#383;e I have a
  mind to try whether I conjecture aright, when I imagine that Allom,
  though it be plainly a Mixt Body, does abound rather with Acid than
  Sulphureous Salt. To &#383;atisfie my &#383;elf herein, I turn my back to
  the Light, and holding a &#383;mall Vial full of the Tincture of
  <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>, which look'd upon in that Po&#383;ition,
  appears Cæruleous, I drop into it a little of a &#383;trong Solution of
  Allom made in Fair Water, and finding upon the <!-- Page 214 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214"></a>[pg 214]</span> Affu&#383;ion and
  &#383;haking of this New liquor, that the Blewne&#383;s formerly
  con&#383;picuous in our Tincture does pre&#383;ently vani&#383;h, I am
  thereby incited to &#383;uppo&#383;e, that the Salt Prædominant in Allom
  belongs to the Family of Sour Salts; but if on the other &#383;ide I have
  a mind to examine whether or no I rightly conceive that Salt of Urine, or
  of Harts-horn is rather of a Saline Sulphureous (if I may &#383;o
  &#383;peak) than of an Acid Nature, I drop a little of the Saline Spirit
  of either into the Nephritick Tincture, and finding that the Cæruleous
  Colour is rather thereby Deepned than De&#383;troy'd, I collect that the
  Salts, which con&#383;titute the&#383;e Spirits, are rather Sulphureous
  than Acid. And to &#383;atisfie my &#383;elf yet farther in this
  particular, I take a &#383;mall Vial of fre&#383;h Tincture, and placing
  both it and my &#383;elf in reference to the Light as formerly, I drop
  into the Infu&#383;ion ju&#383;t as much Di&#383;till'd Vinegar, or other
  Acid liquor as will &#383;erve to Deprive it of its Blewne&#383;s (which
  a few drops, if the Sour Liquor be &#383;trong, and the Vial &#383;mall
  will &#383;uffice to do) then without changing my Po&#383;ture, I drop
  and &#383;hake into the &#383;ame Vial a &#383;mall proportion of Spirit
  of Hart&#383;horn or Urine, and finding that upon this affu&#383;ion, the
  Tincture immediately recovers its Cæruleous Colour, I am thereby
  confirm'd <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_215"></a>[pg 215]</span> firm'd in my former Opinion, of the
  Sulphureous Nature of the&#383;e Salts. And &#383;o, whereas it is much
  doubted by Some Modern Chymi&#383;ts to what &#383;ort of Salt, that
  which is Prædominant in Quick-lime belongs, we have been per&#383;waded
  to referr it rather to Lixiviate than Acid Salts, by having
  ob&#383;erv'd, that though an Evaporated Infu&#383;ion of it will
  &#383;carce yield &#383;uch a Salt, as A&#383;hes and other Alcalizate
  Bodyes are wont to do, yet if we deprive our Nephritick Tincture of its
  Blewne&#383;s by ju&#383;t &#383;o much Di&#383;till'd Vinegar as is
  requi&#383;ite to make that Colour Vani&#383;h, the <i>Lixivium</i> of
  Quick-lime will immediately upon its Affu&#383;ion recall the
  Bani&#383;hed Colour; but not &#383;o Powerfully as either of the
  Sulphureous Liquors formerly mention'd. And therefore I allow my
  &#383;elf to gue&#383;s at the <i>Strength</i> of the Liquors examin'd by
  this Experiment, by the <i>Quantity</i> of them which is &#383;ufficient
  to De&#383;troy or Re&#383;tore the Cæruleous Colour of our Tincture. But
  whether concerning Liquors, wherein neither Acid nor Alcali&#383;ate
  Salts are Eminently Prædominant, our Tincture will enable us to
  conjecture any thing more than that &#383;uch Salts are not Prædominant
  in them, I take not upon me to determine here, but leave to further
  Tryal; For I find not that Spirit of <!-- Page 216 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216"></a>[pg 216]</span> Wine, Spirit of
  Tartar freed from Acidity, or Chymical Oyl of Turpentine, (although
  Liquors which mu&#383;t be conceiv'd very Saline, if Chymi&#383;ts have,
  which is here no place to Di&#383;pute, rightly a&#383;crib'd ta&#383;ts
  to the Saline Principle of Bodyes,) have any Remarkable Power either to
  deprive our Tincture of its Cæruleous Colour, or re&#383;tore it, when
  upon the Affu&#383;ion of Spirit of Vinegar it has di&#383;appear'd.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XI.</i></h3>

  <p>And here I mu&#383;t not omit, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, to inform You, that
  we can &#383;hew You even in a Mineral Body &#383;omething that may
  &#383;eem very near of Kin to the Changeable Quality of the Tincture of
  <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>, for we have &#383;everal flat pieces of
  Gla&#383;s, of the thickne&#383;s of ordinary Panes for Windows one of
  which being interpo&#383;ed betwixt the Eye and a clear Light, appears of
  a Golden Colour, not much unlike that of the moderate Tincture of our
  Wood, but being &#383;o look'd upon as that the Beams of light are not
  &#383;o much Trajected thorough it as Reflected from it to the Eye, that
  Yellow &#383;eems to degenerate into a pale Blew, &#383;omewhat like that
  of a Turquoi&#383;e. And what which may al&#383;o appear &#383;trange, is
  this, <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217"></a>[pg
  217]</span> that if in a certain po&#383;ture you hold one of the&#383;e
  Plates Perpendicular to the Horizon, &#383;o that the Sun-beams
  &#383;hine upon half of it, the other half being Shaded, You may &#383;ee
  that the part Shin'd upon will be of a much Diluter Yellow than the
  Shaded part which will appear much more Richly Colour'd; and if You alter
  the Po&#383;ture of the Gla&#383;s, &#383;o that it be not held
  Perpendicular, but Parallel in reference to the Horizon, You may
  &#383;ee, (which perhaps you will admire) the Shaded part look of a
  Golden Colour, but the other that the Sun &#383;hines freely on, will
  appear con&#383;iderably Blew, and as you remove any part of the
  Gla&#383;s thus held Horizontally into the Sun-beams or Shade, it will in
  the twinkling of an Eye &#383;eem to pa&#383;s from one of the above
  mention'd Colours to the other, the Sun-beams Trajected through it upon a
  &#383;heet of White Paper held near it, do colour it with a Yellow,
  &#383;omewhat bordering upon a Red, but yet the Gla&#383;s may be &#383;o
  oppos'd to the Sun, that it may upon Paper project a mix'd Colour here
  and there more inclin'd to Yellow, and here and there more to Blew. The
  other Phænomena of this odd Gla&#383;s, I fear it would be &#383;carce
  worth while to Record, and therefore I &#383;hall rather adverti&#383;e
  You, <i>Fir&#383;t</i> that in the trying of the&#383;e Experiments <!--
  Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218"></a>[pg 218]</span>
  with it, you mu&#383;t take notice that one of the &#383;ides has either
  alone, or at lea&#383;t principally its Superficial parts di&#383;pos'd
  to the Reflection of the Blew Colour above nam'd, and that therefore you
  mu&#383;t have a care to keep that &#383;ide neare&#383;t to the Eye. And
  next, that we have our &#383;elves made Gla&#383;&#383;es not unfit to
  exhibit an Experiment not unlike that I have been &#383;peaking of, by
  laying upon pieces of Gla&#383;s &#383;ome very finely foliated Silver,
  and giving it by degrees a much &#383;tronger Fire than is requi&#383;ite
  or u&#383;ual for the Tinging of Gla&#383;&#383;es of other Colours. And
  this Experiment, not to mention that it was made without a Furnace in
  which Artificers that Paint Gla&#383;s are wont to be very Curious, is
  the more con&#383;iderable, becau&#383;e, that though a Skilfull Painter
  could not deny to me that 'twas with Silver he Colour'd his
  Gla&#383;&#383;es Yellow; yet he told me, that when to Burn them (as they
  &#383;peak) he layes on the plates of Gla&#383;s nothing but a
  <i>Calx</i> of Silver Calcin'd without Corro&#383;ive Liquors, and
  Temper'd with Fair Water, the Plates are Ting'd of a fine Yellow that
  looks of a Golden Colour, which part &#383;oever of it you turn to or
  from the Light; whereas (whether it be what an Artificer would call
  Over-doing, or Burning, or el&#383;e the imploying the Silver <!-- Page
  219 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219"></a>[pg 219]</span> Crude
  that makes the Difference,) we have found more than once, that &#383;ome
  Pieces of Gla&#383;s prepar'd as we have related, though held
  again&#383;t the Light they appear'd of a Tran&#383;parent Yellow, yet
  look'd on with ones back turn'd to the Light they exhibited an
  Untran&#383;parent Blew.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XII.</i></h3>

  <p>If you will allow me, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, for the avoiding of
  Ambiguity, to imploy the Word Pigments, to &#383;ignifie &#383;uch
  prepared materials (as Cochinele, Vermilion, Orpiment,) as Painters,
  Dyers and other Artificers make u&#383;e of to impart or imitate
  particular Colours, I &#383;hall be the better under&#383;tood in divers
  pa&#383;&#383;ages of the following papers, and particularly when I tell
  you, That the mixing of Pigments being no incon&#383;iderable part of the
  Painters Art, it may &#383;eem an Incroachment in me to meddle with it.
  But I think I may ea&#383;ily be excus'd (though I do not altogether
  pa&#383;s it by) if I re&#383;train my &#383;elf to the making of a
  Tran&#383;ient mention of &#383;ome few of their Practices about this
  matter; and that only &#383;o far forth, as may warrant me to
  ob&#383;erve to you, that there are but few Simple and Primary Colours
  (if I may &#383;o call them) <!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_220"></a>[pg 220]</span> from who&#383;e Various
  Compo&#383;itions all the re&#383;t do as it were Re&#383;ult. For though
  Painters can imitate the Hues (though not always the Splendor) of
  tho&#383;e almo&#383;t Numberle&#383;s differing Colours that are to be
  met with in the Works of Nature, and of Art, I have not yet found, that
  to exhibit this &#383;trange Variety they need imploy any more than
  <i>White</i>, and <i>Black</i>, and <i>Red</i>, and <i>Blew</i>, and
  <i>Yellow</i>; the&#383;e <i>five</i>, Variou&#383;ly <i>Compounded</i>,
  and (if I may &#383;o &#383;peak) <i>Decompounded</i>, being
  &#383;ufficient to exhibit a Variety and Number of Colours, &#383;uch, as
  tho&#383;e that are altogether Strangers to the Painters Pallets, can
  hardly imagine.</p>

  <p>Thus (for In&#383;tance) Black and White differingly mix'd, make a
  Va&#383;t company of Lighter and Darker Grays.</p>

  <p>Blew and Yellow make a huge Variety of Greens.</p>

  <p>Red and Yellow make Orange Tawny.</p>

  <p>Red with a little White makes a Carnation.</p>

  <p>Red with an Eye of Blew, makes a Purple; and by the&#383;e &#383;imple
  Compo&#383;itions again Compounded among them&#383;elves, the Skilfull
  Painter can produce what kind of Colour he plea&#383;es, and a great many
  more than we have yet Names for. But, as I intimated above, 'tis not my
  De&#383;ign <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  though I thought it not unfit to take &#383;ome Notice of it,
  becau&#383;e we may hereafter have occa&#383;ion to make u&#383;e of what
  has been now deliver'd, to illu&#383;trate the Generation of Intermediate
  Colours; concerning which we mu&#383;t yet &#383;ubjoyn this Caution,
  that to make the Rules about the Emergency of Colours, fit to be Relied
  upon, the Corpu&#383;cles whereof the Pigments con&#383;i&#383;t
  mu&#383;t be &#383;uch as do not De&#383;troy one anothers Texture, for
  in ca&#383;e they do, the produced Colour may be very Different from that
  which would Re&#383;ult from the Mixture of other harmle&#383;s Pigments
  of the &#383;ame Colours, as I &#383;hall have Occa&#383;ion to &#383;hew
  ere long.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XIII.</i></h3>

  <p>It may al&#383;o give much light to an Enquirer into the Nature of
  Colours, to know that not only in Green, but in many (if not all) other
  Colours, the Light of the Sun pa&#383;&#383;ing through Diaphanous Bodies
  of differing Hues may be tinged of the &#383;ame Compound Colour, as if
  it came from &#383;ome Painters Colours of the &#383;ame Denomination,
  though this later be exhibited by Reflection, and be (as the <!-- Page
  222 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222"></a>[pg 222]</span>
  former Experiment declares) manife&#383;tly Compounded of material
  Pigments. Wherefore to try the Compo&#383;ition of Colours by Trajection,
  we provided &#383;everal Plates of Tinged Gla&#383;s, which being laid
  two at a time one on the top of another, the Object look'd upon through
  them both, appear'd of a Compounded Colour, which agrees well with what
  we have ob&#383;erv'd in the &#383;econd Experiment, of Looking
  again&#383;t the Light through differingly Colour'd Papers. But we
  thought the Experiment would be more Satisfactory, if we procur'd the
  Sun-beams to be &#383;o Ting'd in their pa&#383;&#383;age through Plates
  of Gla&#383;s, as to exhibit the Compounded Colour upon a Sheet of White
  Paper. And though by rea&#383;on of the Thickne&#383;s of the
  Gla&#383;&#383;es, the Effect was but Faint, even when the Sun was High
  and Shin'd forth clear, yet, we ea&#383;ily remedied that by Contracting
  the Beams we ca&#383;t on them by means of a Convex Burning-gla&#383;s,
  which where it made the Beams much converge Increas'd the Light enough to
  make the Compounded Colour very manife&#383;t upon the Paper. By this
  means we ob&#383;erv'd, that the Beams trajected through Blew and Yellow
  compos'd a Green, that an inten&#383;e and moderate Red did with Yellow
  make differing <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_223"></a>[pg 223]</span> degrees of Saffron, and Orange Tawny
  Colours, that Green and Blew made a Colour partaking of both, &#383;uch
  as that which &#383;ome Latin Writers call <i>Pavonaceus</i>, that Red
  and Blew made a Purple, to which we might add other Colours, that we
  produc'd by the Combinations of Gla&#383;&#383;es differingly Ting'd, but
  that I want proper Words to expre&#383;s them in our Language, and had
  not when we made the Tryals, the Opportunity of con&#383;ulting with a
  Painter, who perchance might have Suppli'd me with &#383;ome of the terms
  I wanted.</p>

  <p>I know not whether it will be requi&#383;ite to &#383;ubjoyn on this
  Occa&#383;ion, what I tried concerning Reflections from Colour'd
  Gla&#383;&#383;es, and other Tran&#383;parent Bodies, namely, that having
  expos'd four or five &#383;orts of them to the Sun, and ca&#383;t the
  Reflected Beams upon White Paper held near at hand, the Light appear'd
  not manife&#383;tly Ting'd, but as if it had been Reflected from the
  Impervious parts of a Colourle&#383;s Gla&#383;s, only that Reflected
  from the Yellow was here and there &#383;tain'd with the &#383;ame
  Colour, as if tho&#383;e Beams were not all Reflected from the
  Superficial, but &#383;ome from the Internal parts of the Gla&#383;s;
  upon which Occa&#383;ion you may take notice, that a Skilfull
  Trade&#383;man, who makes &#383;uch Colour'd <!-- Page 224 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224"></a>[pg 224]</span> Gla&#383;s told
  me, that where as the Red Pigment was but Superficial, the Yellow
  penetrated to the very mid&#383;t of the Plate. But for further
  Satisfaction, not having the Opportunity to Foliate tho&#383;e Plates,
  and &#383;o turn them into Looking-gla&#383;&#383;es, we Foliated a Plate
  of <i>Mu&#383;covy</i> Gla&#383;s, and then laying on it a little
  Tran&#383;parent Varni&#383;h of a Gold Colour, we expos'd it to the
  Sun-beams, &#383;o as to ca&#383;t them upon a Body fit to receive them,
  on which the Reflected Light, appearing, as we expected, Yellow,
  manife&#383;ted that Rebounding from the Specular part of the
  <i>Selenitis</i>, it was Ting'd in its return with the Colour of the
  Tran&#383;parent Varni&#383;h through which it pa&#383;s'd.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XIV.</i></h3>

  <p>After what we have &#383;aid of the Compo&#383;ition of Colours, it
  will now be &#383;ea&#383;onable to annex &#383;ome Experiments that we
  made in favour of tho&#383;e Colours, that are taught in the Schools not
  to be Real, but only Apparent and Phanta&#383;tical; For we found by
  Tryals, that the&#383;e Colours might be Compounded, both with True and
  Stable Colours, and with one another, as well as unque&#383;tionably
  Genuine and La&#383;ting Colours, and that the Colours <!-- Page 225
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225"></a>[pg 225]</span>
  re&#383;ulting from &#383;uch Compo&#383;itions, would re&#383;pectively
  de&#383;erve the &#383;ame Denominations.</p>

  <p>For fir&#383;t, having by the Trajection of the Sun-beams through a
  Gla&#383;s-pri&#383;m thrown an Iris on the Floor, I found that by
  placing a Blew Gla&#383;s at a convenient di&#383;tance betwixt the
  Pri&#383;m and the Iris, that part of the Iris that was before Yellow,
  might be made to appear Green, though not of a Gra&#383;s Green, but of
  one more Dilute and Yellowi&#383;h. And it &#383;eems not improbable,
  that the narrow Greeni&#383;h Li&#383;t (if I may &#383;o call it) that
  is wont to be &#383;een between the Yellow and Blew parts of the Iris, is
  made by the Confu&#383;ion of tho&#383;e two Bordering Colours.</p>

  <p>Next, I found, that though the want of a &#383;ufficient
  Liveline&#383;s in either of the Compounding Colours, or a light Error in
  the manner of making the following Tryals, was enough to render &#383;ome
  of them Un&#383;ucce&#383;sfull, yet when all nece&#383;&#383;ary
  Circum&#383;tances were duely ob&#383;erv'd, the Event was
  an&#383;werable to our Expectation and De&#383;ire.</p>

  <p>And (as I formerly Noted) that Red and Blew compound a Purple, &#383;o
  I could produce this la&#383;t nam'd Colour, by ca&#383;ting at &#383;ome
  Di&#383;tance from the Gla&#383;s the Blew <!-- Page 226 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226"></a>[pg 226]</span> part of the
  Pri&#383;matical Iris (as I think it may be call'd for Di&#383;tinction
  &#383;ake) upon a Lively Red, (for el&#383;e the Experiment &#383;ucceeds
  not &#383;o well.) And I remember, that &#383;ometimes when I try'd this
  upon a piece of Red Cloath, <i>that</i> part of the Iris which would have
  been Blew, (as I try'd by covering that part of the Cloath with a piece
  of White Paper) and Compounded with the Red, wherewith the Cloath was
  Imbued before, appear'd of a fair Purple, did, when I came to View it
  near at hand, look very Odly, as if there were &#383;ome &#383;trange
  Reflection or Refraction or both made in the Hairs of which that Cloath
  was compo&#383;ed.</p>

  <p>Calling likewi&#383;e the Pri&#383;matical Iris upon a very Vivid
  Blew, I found that part of it, which would el&#383;e have been the
  Yellow, appear Green. (Another &#383;omewhat differing Tryal, and yet fit
  to confirm this, you will find in the fifteenth Experiment.)</p>

  <p>But it may &#383;eem &#383;omewhat more &#383;trange, that though the
  Pri&#383;matical Iris being made by the Refraction of Light through a
  Body that has no Colour at all, mu&#383;t according to the Doctrine of
  the Schools con&#383;i&#383;t of as purely Emphatical Colours, as may be,
  yet even the&#383;e may be Compounded with one another, as well as Real
  Colours in <!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_227"></a>[pg 227]</span> the Gro&#383;&#383;e&#383;t Pigments.
  For I took at once two Triangular Gla&#383;&#383;es, and one of them
  being kept fixt in the &#383;ame Po&#383;ture, that the Iris it projected
  on the Floor might not Waver, I ca&#383;t on the &#383;ame Floor another
  Iris with the other Pri&#383;m, and Moving it too and fro to bring what
  part of the &#383;econd Iris I pleas'd, to fall upon what part of the
  fir&#383;t I thought fit, we did &#383;ometimes (for a &#383;mall Errour
  &#383;uffices to hinder the Succe&#383;s) obtain by this means a Green
  Colour in that part of the more Stable Iris, that before was Yellow, or
  Blew, and frequently by ca&#383;ting tho&#383;e Beams that in one of the
  Iris's made the Blew upon the Red parts of the other Iris, we were able
  to produce a lovely Purple, which we can De&#383;troy or Recompo&#383;e
  at plea&#383;ure, by Severing and Reapproaching the Edges of the two
  Iris's.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XV.</i></h3>

  <p>On this occa&#383;ion, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, I &#383;hall add, that
  finding the Gla&#383;s-pri&#383;m to be the u&#383;efulle&#383;t
  In&#383;trument Men have yet imploy'd about the Contemplation of Colours,
  and con&#383;idering that Pri&#383;ms hitherto in u&#383;e are made of
  Gla&#383;s, Tran&#383;parent and Colourle&#383;s, I thought it would not
  be ami&#383;s to try, <!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_228"></a>[pg 228]</span> what change the Superinduction of a
  Colour, without the De&#383;truction of the Diaphaneity, would produce in
  the Colours exhibited by the Pri&#383;m. But being unable to procure one
  to be made of Colour'd Gla&#383;s, and fearing al&#383;o that if it were
  not carefully made, the Thickne&#383;s of it would render it too Opacous,
  I endeavoured to &#383;ub&#383;titute one made of Clarify'd Ro&#383;in,
  or of Turpentine brought (as I el&#383;ewhere teach) to the
  con&#383;i&#383;tence of a Tran&#383;parent Gum. But though the&#383;e
  Endeavours were not wholly lo&#383;t, yet we found it &#383;o difficult
  to give the&#383;e Materials their true Shape, that we cho&#383;e rather
  to Varni&#383;h over an ordinary Pri&#383;m with &#383;ome of the&#383;e
  few Pigments that are to be had Tran&#383;parent; as accordingly we did
  fir&#383;t with Yellow, and then with Red, or rather Crim&#383;on, made
  with Lake temper'd with a convenient Oyl, and the Event was, That for
  want of good Tran&#383;parent Colours, (of which you know there are but
  very few) both the Yellow and the Red made the Gla&#383;s &#383;o
  Opacous, (though the Pigment were laid on but upon two Sides of the
  Gla&#383;s, no more being ab&#383;olutely nece&#383;&#383;ary) that
  unle&#383;s I look'd upon an Inlightned Window, or the Flame of a Candle,
  or &#383;ome other Luminous or very Vivid object, <!-- Page 229 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229"></a>[pg 229]</span> I could
  &#383;carce di&#383;cern any Colours at all, e&#383;pecially when the
  Gla&#383;s was cover'd with Red. But when I did look on &#383;uch
  Objects, it appear'd (as I expected) that the Colour of the Pigment had
  Vitiated or Drown'd &#383;ome of tho&#383;e which the Pri&#383;m would
  according to its wont have exhibited, and mingling with others, Alter'd
  them: as I remember, that both to my Eyes, and others to whom I
  &#383;how'd it, when the Pri&#383;m was cover'd with Yellow, it made
  tho&#383;e Parts of bright Objects, where the Blew would el&#383;e have
  been Con&#383;picuous, appear of a light Green. But, <i>Pyrophilus</i>,
  both the Nature of the Colours, and the Degree of Tran&#383;parency, or
  of Darkne&#383;s in the Pigment, be&#383;ides divers other
  Circum&#383;tances, did &#383;o vary the <i>Phænomena</i> of the&#383;e
  Tryals, that till I can procure &#383;mall Colour'd Pri&#383;ms, or
  Hollow ones that may be filled with Tincted Liquor, or obtain Some better
  Pigments than tho&#383;e I was reduc'd to imploy, I &#383;hall forbear to
  Build any thing upon what has been delivered, and &#383;hall make no
  other u&#383;e of it, than to invite you to pro&#383;ecute the Inquiry
  further.</p>

<!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230"></a>[pg 230]</span>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XVI.</i></h3>

  <p>And here, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, &#383;ince we are treating of Emphatical
  Colours, we &#383;hall add what we think not unworthy your
  Ob&#383;ervation, and not unfit to afford &#383;ome Exerci&#383;e to the
  Speculative. For there are &#383;ome Liquors, which though
  Colourle&#383;s them&#383;elves, when they come to be Elevated, and
  Di&#383;pers'd into Exhalations, exhibit a con&#383;picuous Colour, which
  they lo&#383;e again, when they come to be Reconjoyn'd into a Liquor, as
  good Spirit of <i>Nitre</i>; or upon its account &#383;trong
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, though devoid of all appearance of Redne&#383;s
  whil&#383;t they continue in the form of a Liquor, if a little Heat
  chance to turn the Minute parts of them into Vapour, the Steam will
  appear of a Reddi&#383;h or deep Yellow Colour, which will Vani&#383;h
  when tho&#383;e Exhalations come to re&#383;ume the form of Liquor.</p>

  <p>And not only if you look upon a Gla&#383;s half full of
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, or Spirit of <i>Nitre</i>, and half full of
  <i>Nitrous</i> &#383;teams proceeding from it, you will &#383;ee the
  Upper part of the Gla&#383;s of the Colour fre&#383;hly mention'd, if
  through it you look upon the Light. But which is much more
  con&#383;iderable, I <!-- Page 231 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_231"></a>[pg 231]</span> have tried, that putting
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i> in a long clear Gla&#383;s, and adding a little Copper
  or &#383;ome &#383;uch open Metall to it, to excite Heat and Fumes, the
  Light trajected through tho&#383;e Fumes, and ca&#383;t upon a &#383;heet
  of White Paper, did upon that appear of the Colour that the Fumes did,
  when directly Look'd upon, as if the Light were as well Ting'd in its
  pa&#383;&#383;age through the&#383;e Fumes, as it would have been by
  pa&#383;&#383;ing through &#383;ome Gla&#383;s or Liquor in which the
  &#383;ame Colour was Inherent.</p>

  <p>To which I &#383;hall further add, that having &#383;ometimes had the
  Curio&#383;ity to ob&#383;erve whether the Beams of the Sun near the
  Horizon trajected through a very Red Sky, would not (though &#383;uch
  redne&#383;&#383;es are taken to be but Emphatical Colours) exhibit the
  like Colour, I found that the Beams falling within a Room upon a very
  White Object, plac'd directly oppo&#383;ite to the Sun, di&#383;clos'd a
  manife&#383;t Redne&#383;s, as if they had pa&#383;s'd through a Colour'd
  <i>Medium</i>.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XVII.</i></h3>

  <p>The emergency, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, of Colours upon the Coalition of the
  Particles of &#383;uch Bodies as were neither of them of the Colour of
  that Mixture whereof they are the <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232"></a>[pg 232]</span> Ingredients, is
  very well worth our attentive Ob&#383;ervation, as being of good u&#383;e
  both Speculative and Practical; For much of the Mechanical u&#383;e of
  Colours among Painters and Dyers, doth depend upon the Knowledge of what
  Colours may be produc'd by the Mixtures of Pigments &#383;o and &#383;o
  Colour'd. And (as we lately intimated) 'tis of advantage to the
  contemplative Naturali&#383;t, to know how many and which Colours are
  Primitive (if I may &#383;o call them) and Simple, becau&#383;e it both
  ea&#383;es his Labour by confining his mo&#383;t &#383;ollicitous Enquiry
  to a &#383;mall Number of Colours upon which the re&#383;t depend, and
  a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ts him to judge of the nature of particular
  compounded Colours, by &#383;hewing him from the Mixture of what more
  Simple ones, and of what Proportions of them to one another, the
  particular Colour to be con&#383;ider'd does re&#383;ult. But
  becau&#383;e to in&#383;i&#383;t on the Proportions, the Manner and the
  Effects of &#383;uch Mixtures would oblige me to con&#383;ider a greater
  part of the Painters Art and Dyers Trade, than I am well acquainted with,
  I confin'd my &#383;elf to make Trial of <i>&#383;everal ways to produce
  Green</i>, by the compo&#383;ition of Blew and Yellow. And &#383;hall in
  this place both Recapitulate mo&#383;t of the things I have
  Di&#383;per&#383;edly deliver'd <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_233"></a>[pg 233]</span> already concerning that Subject, and
  Recruit them.</p>

  <p>And fir&#383;t, whereas Painters (as I noted above) are wont to make
  Green by tempering Blew and Yellow, both of them made into a &#383;oft
  Con&#383;i&#383;tence, with either Water or Oyl, or &#383;ome Liquor of
  Kin to one of tho&#383;e two, according as the Picture is to be Drawn
  with tho&#383;e they call <i>water Colours</i>, or tho&#383;e they term
  <i>Oyl Colours</i>, I found that by choo&#383;ing fit Ingredients, and
  mixing them in the form of Dry Powders, I could do, what I could not if
  the Ingredients were temper'd up with a Liquor; But the Blew and Yellow
  Powders mu&#383;t not only be finely Ground, but &#383;uch as that the
  Corpu&#383;cles of the one may not be too unequal to tho&#383;e of the
  other, le&#383;t by their Di&#383;proportionate Minutene&#383;s the
  Smaller cover and hide the Greater. We us'd with good &#383;ucce&#383;s a
  &#383;light Mixture of the fine Powder of Bi&#383;e, with that of
  Orpiment, or that of good Yellow Oker, I &#383;ay a <i>&#383;light</i>
  Mixture, becau&#383;e we found that an <i>exqui&#383;ite</i> Mixture did
  not do &#383;o well, but by lightly mingling the two Pigments in
  &#383;everal little Parcels, tho&#383;e of them in which the Proportion
  and Manner of Mixture was more Lucky, afforded us a good Green.</p>

<!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234"></a>[pg 234]</span>

  <p>2. We al&#383;o learn'd in the Dye-hou&#383;es, that Cloth being Dy'd
  Blew with Woad, is afterwards by the Yellow Decoction of <i>Luteola</i>
  or <!-- Erratum: insert --> Woud-wax or Wood-wax Dy'd into a Green
  Colour.</p>

  <p>3. You may al&#383;o remember what we above Related, where we
  intimated, that having in a Darkn'd Room taken two Bodies, a Blew and a
  Yellow, and ca&#383;t the Light Reflected from the one upon the other, we
  likewi&#383;e obtain'd a Green.</p>

  <p>4. And you may remember, that we ob&#383;erv'd a Green to be produc'd,
  when in the &#383;ame Darkn'd Room we look'd at the Hole at which alone
  the Light enter'd, through the Green and Yellow parts of a &#383;heet of
  Marbl'd Paper laid over one another.</p>

  <p>5. We found too, that the Beams of the Sun being trajected through two
  pieces of Gla&#383;s, the one Blew and the other Yellow, laid over one
  another, did upon a &#383;heet of White paper on which they were made to
  fall, exhibit a lovely Green.</p>

  <p>6. I hope al&#383;o, that you have not already forgot, what was
  &#383;o lately deliver'd, concerning the compo&#383;ition of a Green,
  with a Blew and Yellow; of which mo&#383;t Authors would call the one a
  <i>Real</i>, and the other an <i>Emphatical</i>.</p>

<!-- Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235"></a>[pg 235]</span>

  <p>7. And I pre&#383;ume, you may have yet fre&#383;h in your memory,
  what the fourteenth Experiment informs you, concerning the exhibiting of
  a Green, by the help of a Blew and Yellow, that were both of them
  Emphatical.</p>

  <p>8. Wherefore we will proceed to take notice, that we al&#383;o devis'd
  a way of trying whether or no Metalline Solutions though one of them at
  lea&#383;t had its Colour Adventitious, by the mixture of the
  <i>Menstruum</i> employ'd to di&#383;&#383;olve it, might not be made to
  compound a Green after the manner of other Bodies. And though this
  &#383;eem'd not ea&#383;ie to be perform'd by rea&#383;on of the
  Difficulty of finding Metalline Solutions of the Colour requi&#383;ite,
  that would mix without Præcipitating each other; yet after a while having
  con&#383;ider'd the matter, the fir&#383;t Tryal afforded me the
  following Experiment. I took a High Yellow Solution of good Gold in
  <i>Aqua-Regis</i>, (made of <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, and as I remember half
  its weight of Spirit of Salt) To this I put a due Proportion of a deep
  and lovely Blew Solution of Crude Copper, (which I have el&#383;ewhere
  taught to be readily Di&#383;&#383;oluble in &#383;trong Spirit of Urine)
  and the&#383;e two Liquors though at fir&#383;t they &#383;eem'd a little
  to Curdle one another, yet being throughly mingl'd by Shaking, <!-- Page
  236 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236"></a>[pg 236]</span> they
  pre&#383;ently, as had been Conjectur'd, united into a Tran&#383;parent
  Green Liquor, which continu'd &#383;o for divers days that I kept it in a
  &#383;mall Gla&#383;s wherein 'twas made, only letting fall a little
  Blacki&#383;h Powder to the Bottom. The other <i>Phænomena</i> of this
  Experiment belong not to this place, where it may &#383;uffice to take
  notice of the Production of a Green, and that the Experiment was more
  than once repeated with Succe&#383;s.</p>

  <p>9. And la&#383;tly, to try whether this way of compounding Colours
  would hold ev'n in Ingredients actually melted by the Violence of the
  Fire, provided their Texture were capable of &#383;afely induring
  Fu&#383;ion, we caus'd &#383;ome Blew and Yellow Ammel to be long and
  well wrought together in the Flame of a Lamp, which being Strongly and
  Ince&#383;&#383;antly blown on them kept them in &#383;ome degree of
  Fu&#383;ion, and at length (for the Experiment requires &#383;ome
  Patience as well as Skil) we obtain'd the expected Ammel of a Green
  Colour.</p>

  <p>I know not, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, whether it be worth while to acquaint
  you with the ways that came into my Thoughts, whereby in &#383;ome
  mea&#383;ure to explicate the fir&#383;t of the mention'd ways of making
  a Green; for I have &#383;ometimes Conjectur'd, that the mixture <!--
  Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237"></a>[pg 237]</span>
  of the Bi&#383;e and the Orpiment produc'd a Green by &#383;o altering
  the Superficial A&#383;perity, which each of tho&#383;e Ingredients had
  apart, that the Light Incident on the mixture was Reflected with
  differing Shades, as to Quantity, or Order, or both, from tho&#383;e of
  either of the Ingredients, and &#383;uch as the Light is wont to be
  Modify'd with, when it Reflects from Gra&#383;s, or Leaves, or &#383;ome
  of tho&#383;e other Bodies that we are wont to call Green. And
  &#383;ometimes too I have doubted, whether the produced Green might not
  be partly at lea&#383;t deriv'd from this, That the Beams that Rebound
  from the Corpu&#383;cles of the Orpiment, giving one kind of &#383;troak
  upon the <i>Retina</i>, who&#383;e Perception we call Yellow, and the
  Beams Reflected from the Corpu&#383;cles of the Bi&#383;e, giving another
  &#383;troak upon the &#383;ame <i>Retina</i>, like to Objects that are
  Blew, the Contiguity and Minutene&#383;s of the&#383;e Corpu&#383;cles
  may make the Appul&#383;e of the Reflected Light fall upon the
  <i>Retina</i> within &#383;o narrow a Compa&#383;s, that the part they
  Beat upon being but as it were a Phy&#383;ical point, they may give a
  Compounded &#383;troak, which may con&#383;equently exhibit a Compounded
  and new Kind of Sen&#383;ation, as we &#383;ee that two Strings of a
  Mu&#383;ical In&#383;trument being &#383;truck together, making two <!--
  Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238"></a>[pg 238]</span>
  Noi&#383;es that arrive at the Ear at the &#383;ame time as to
  Sen&#383;e, yield a Sound differing from either of them, and as it were
  Compounded of both; In&#383;omuch that if they be Di&#383;cordantly
  ton'd, though each of them &#383;truck apart would yield a Plea&#383;ing
  Sound, yet being &#383;truck together they make but a Har&#383;h and
  trouble&#383;ome Noi&#383;e. But this not being &#383;o fit a place to
  pro&#383;ecute Speculations, I &#383;hall not in&#383;i&#383;t, neither
  upon the&#383;e Conjectures nor any others, which the Experiment we have
  been mentioning may have &#383;ugge&#383;ted to me. And I &#383;hall
  leave it to you, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, to derive what In&#383;truction you
  can from comparing together the Various ways whereby a Yellow and a Blew
  can be made to Compound a Green. That which I now pretend to, being only
  to &#383;hew that the fir&#383;t of tho&#383;e mention'd ways, (not to
  take at pre&#383;ent notice of the re&#383;t) does far better agree with
  our Conjectures about Colours, than either with the Doctrine of the
  Schools, or with that of the <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i>, both which &#383;eem
  to be very much Disfavour'd by it.</p>

  <p>For fir&#383;t, &#383;ince in the Mixture of the two mention'd Powders
  I could by the help of a very excellent <i>Micro&#383;cope</i> (for
  ordinary ones will &#383;carce &#383;erve the turn) di&#383;cover that
  which &#383;eem'd to the naked Eye a Green <!-- Page 239 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239"></a>[pg 239]</span> Body, to be but a
  heap of Di&#383;tinct, though very &#383;mall Grains of Yellow Orpiment
  and Blew Bi&#383;e confu&#383;edly enough Blended together, it appears
  that the Colour'd Corpu&#383;cles of either kind did each retain its own
  Nature and Colour; By which it may be gue&#383;s'd, what meer
  Tran&#383;po&#383;ition and Juxtapo&#383;ition of Minute and Singly
  unchang'd Particles of Matter can do to produce a new Colour; For that
  this Local Motion and new Di&#383;po&#383;ition of the &#383;mall parts
  of the Orpiment did Intervene is much more manife&#383;t than it is
  ea&#383;ie to Explicate how they &#383;hould produce this new Green
  otherwi&#383;e than by the new Manner of their being put together, and
  con&#383;equently by their new Di&#383;po&#383;ition to Modifie the
  Incident Light by Reflecting it otherwi&#383;e than they did before they
  were Mingl'd together.</p>

  <p>Secondly, The Green thus made being (if I may &#383;o &#383;peak)
  Mechanically produc'd, there is no pretence to derive it from I know not
  what incomprehen&#383;ible Sub&#383;tantial Form, from which yet many
  would have us believe that Colours mu&#383;t flow; Nor does this Green,
  though a Real and Permanent, not a Phanta&#383;tical and Vanid Colour,
  &#383;eem to be &#383;uch an Inherent Quality as they would have it,
  &#383;ince not only each part of <!-- Page 240 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240"></a>[pg 240]</span> the Mixture
  remains unalter'd in Colour, and con&#383;equently of a differing Colour
  from the Heap they Compo&#383;e, but if the Eye be
  a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted by a <i>Micro&#383;cope</i> to di&#383;cern
  things better and more di&#383;tinctly than before it could, it &#383;ees
  not a Green Body, but a Heap of Blew and Yellow Corpu&#383;cles.</p>

  <p>And in the third place, I demand what either Sulphur, or Salt, or
  Mercury has to do in the Production of this Green; For neither the
  Bi&#383;e nor the Orpiment were indu'd with that Colour before, and the
  bare Juxtapo&#383;ition of the Corpu&#383;cles of the two Powders that
  work not upon each other, but might if we had convenient In&#383;truments
  be &#383;eparated, unalter'd, cannot with any probability be imagin'd
  either to Increa&#383;e or Dimini&#383;h any of the three
  Hypo&#383;tatical Principles, (to which of them &#383;oever the
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> are pleas'd to a&#383;cribe Colours) nor does there
  here Intervene &#383;o much as Heat to afford them any colour to pretend,
  that at lea&#383;t there is made an Extraver&#383;ion (as the
  <i>Helmontians</i> &#383;peak) of the Sulphur or of any of the two other
  &#383;uppo&#383;ed Principles; But upon this Experiment we have already
  Reflected enough, if not more than enough for once.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XVIII.</i></h3>

  <p>But here, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, I mu&#383;t adverti&#383;e you, that 'tis
  not every Yellow and every Blew that being mingl'd will afford a Green;
  For in ca&#383;e one of the Ingredients do not Act only as endow'd with
  &#383;uch a Colour, but as having a power to alter the Texture of the
  Corpu&#383;cles of the other, &#383;o as to Indi&#383;po&#383;e them to
  Reflect the Light, as Corpu&#383;cles that exhibit a Blew or a Yellow are
  wont to Reflect it, the emergent Colour may be not Green, but &#383;uch
  as the change of Texture in the Corpu&#383;cles of one or both of the
  Ingredients qualifies them to &#383;hew forth; as for in&#383;tance, if
  you let fall a few Drops of Syrrup of Violets upon a piece of White
  Paper, though the Syrrup being &#383;pread will appear Blew, yet mingling
  with it two or three Drops of the lately mention'd Solution of Gold, I
  obtain'd not a Green but a Reddi&#383;h mixture, which I expected from
  the remaining Power of the Acid Salts abounding in the Solution,
  &#383;uch Salts or Saline Spirits being wont, as we &#383;hall &#383;ee
  anon, though weakn'd, &#383;o to work upon that Syrrup as to change it
  into a Red or Reddi&#383;h Colour. And to confirm that for which I allege
  the former <!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_242"></a>[pg 242]</span> Experiment, I &#383;hall add this
  other, that having made a very &#383;trong and high-colour'd Solution of
  Filings of Copper with Spirit of Urine, though the <i>Men&#383;truum</i>
  &#383;eem'd Glutted with the Metall, becau&#383;e I put in &#383;o much
  Filings that many of them remain'd for divers days Undi&#383;&#383;olv'd
  at the Bottom, yet having put three or four Drops of Syrrup of Violets
  upon White Paper, I found that the deep Blew Solution proportionably
  mingl'd with this other Blew Liquor did not make a Blew mixture, but, as
  I expected, a fair Green, upon the account of the Urinous Salt that was
  in the <i>Men&#383;truum</i>.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XIX.</i></h3>

  <p>To &#383;hew the <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i>, that Colours may be made to
  Appear or Vani&#383;h, where there intervenes no Acce&#383;&#383;ion or
  Change either of the Sulphureous, or the Saline, or the Mercurial
  principle (as they &#383;peak) of Bodies: I &#383;hall not make u&#383;e
  of the Iris afforded by the Gla&#383;s-pri&#383;m, nor of the Colours to
  be &#383;een in a fair Morning in tho&#383;e drops of Dew that do in a
  convenient manner Reflect and Refract the Beams of Light to the Eye; But
  I will rather mind them of what they may ob&#383;erve in their <!-- Page
  243 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243"></a>[pg 243]</span> own
  Laboratories, namely, that divers, if not all, Chymical
  E&#383;&#383;ential Oyls, as al&#383;o good Spirit of Wine, being
  &#383;haken till they have good &#383;tore of Bubbles, tho&#383;e Bubbles
  will (if attentively con&#383;ider'd) appear adorn'd with various and
  lovely Colours, which all immediately Vani&#383;h, upon the
  relap&#383;ing of the Liquor that affords tho&#383;e Bubbles their Skins,
  into the re&#383;t of the Oyl, or Spirit of Wine, &#383;o that a
  Colourle&#383;s Liquor may be made in a trice to exhibit variety of
  Colours, and may lo&#383;e them in a moment without the
  Acce&#383;&#383;ion or Diminution of any of its Hypo&#383;tatical
  Principles. And, by the way, 'tis not unworthy our notice, that &#383;ome
  Bodies, as well Colourle&#383;s, as Colour'd, by being brought to a great
  Thinne&#383;s of parts, acquire Colours though they had none before, or
  Colours differing from them they were before endued with: For, not to
  in&#383;i&#383;t on the Variety of Colours, that Water, made
  &#383;omewhat Glutinous by Sope, acquires, when 'tis blown into &#383;uch
  Sphærical Bubbles as Boys are wont to make and play with; Turpentine
  (though it have a Colour deep enough of its own) may (by being blown into
  after a certain manner) be brought to afford Bubbles adorn'd with variety
  of Orient Colours, which though <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_244"></a>[pg 244]</span> they Vani&#383;h after &#383;ome
  while upon the breaking of the Bubbles, yet they would in likelihood
  always exhibit Colours upon their <i>Superfices</i>, (though not always
  the &#383;ame in the &#383;ame Parts of them, but Vary'd according to the
  Incidence of the Sight, and the Po&#383;ition of the Eye) if their
  Texture were durable enough: For I have &#383;een one that was Skill'd at
  fa&#383;hioning Gla&#383;&#383;es by the help of a Lamp, blowing
  &#383;ome of them &#383;o &#383;trongly as to bur&#383;t them, whereupon
  it was found, that the Tenacity of the Metall was &#383;uch, that before
  it broke it &#383;uffer'd it &#383;elf to be reduc'd into Films &#383;o
  extremely thin, that being kept clean they con&#383;tantly &#383;hew'd on
  their Surfaces (but after the manner newly mention'd) the varying Colours
  of the Rain-bow, which were exceedingly Vivid, as I had often opportunity
  to ob&#383;erve in &#383;ome, that I caus'd purpo&#383;ely to be made, to
  keep by me.</p>

  <p>But le&#383;t it &#383;hould be objected, that the above mentioned
  In&#383;tances are drawn from Tran&#383;parent Liquors, it may
  po&#383;&#383;ibly appear, not impertinent to add, what I have
  &#383;ometimes thought upon, and &#383;everal times tried, when I was
  con&#383;idering the Opinions of the <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> about Colours,
  I took then a Feather of a convenient Bigne&#383;s <!-- Page 245 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245"></a>[pg 245]</span> and Shape, and
  holding it at a fit di&#383;tance betwixt my Eye and the Sun when he was
  near the Horizon, me thought there appear'd to me a Variety of little
  Rain-bows, with differing and very vivid Colours, of which none was
  con&#383;tantly to be &#383;een in the Feather; the like
  <i>Phænomenon</i> I have at other times (though not with altogether
  &#383;o good &#383;ucce&#383;s) produc'd, by interpo&#383;ing at a due
  di&#383;tance a piece of Black Ribband betwixt the almo&#383;t
  &#383;etting Sun and my Eye, not to mention the Trials I have made to the
  &#383;ame purpo&#383;e, with other Bodies.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XX.</i></h3>

  <p>Take good Syrrup of Violets, Imprægnated with the Tincture of the
  flowers, drop a little of it upon a White Paper (for by that means the
  Change of Colour will be more con&#383;picuous, and the Experiment may be
  practis'd in &#383;maller Quantities) and on this Liquor let fall two or
  three drops of Spirit either of Salt or Vinegar, or almo&#383;t any other
  eminently Acid Liquor, and upon the Mixture of the&#383;e you &#383;hall
  find the Syrrup immediatly turn'd Red, and the way of Effecting &#383;uch
  a Change has not been unknown to divers Per&#383;ons <!-- Page 246
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246"></a>[pg 246]</span> who have
  produc'd the like, by Spirit of Vitriol, or juice of Limmons, but have
  Groundle&#383;sly a&#383;crib'd the Effect to &#383;ome Peculiar Quality
  of tho&#383;e two Liquors, whereas, (as we have already intimated)
  almo&#383;t any Acid Salt will turn Syrrup of Violets Red. But to improve
  the Experiment, let me add what has not (that I know of) been hitherto
  ob&#383;erv'd, and has, when we fir&#383;t &#383;hew'd it them, appear'd
  &#383;omething &#383;trange, even to tho&#383;e that have been
  inqui&#383;itive into the Nature of Colours; namely, that if in&#383;tead
  of Spirit of Salt, or that of Vinegar, you drop upon the Syrrup of
  Violets a little Oyl of Tartar <i>per Deliquium</i>, or the like quantity
  of Solution of Pota&#383;hes, and rubb them together with your finger,
  you &#383;hall find the Blew Colour of the Syrrup turn'd in a moment into
  a perfect Green, and the like may be perform'd by divers other Liquors,
  as we may have occa&#383;ion el&#383;ewhere to Inform you.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation upon the twentieth Experiment</i>.</p>

  <p>The u&#383;e of what we lately deliver'd concerning the way of turning
  Syrrup of Violets, Red or Green, may be this; That, though it be a far
  more common and procurable <!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_247"></a>[pg 247]</span> Liquor than the Infu&#383;ion of
  <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>, it may yet be ea&#383;ily
  &#383;ub&#383;tituted in its Room, when we have a mind to examine,
  whether or no the Salt predominant in a Liquor or other Body, wherein
  'tis Loo&#383;e and Abundant, belong to the Tribe of <i>Acid</i> Salts or
  not. For if &#383;uch a Body turn the Syrrup of a Red or Reddi&#383;h
  Purple Colour, it does for the mo&#383;t part argue the Body
  (e&#383;pecially if it be a di&#383;till'd Liquor) to abound with Acid
  Salt. But if the Syrrup be made Green, that argues the Predominant Salt
  to be of a Nature repugnant to that of the Tribe of Acids. For, as I find
  that either Spirit of Salt, or Oyl of Vitriol, or <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, or
  Spirit of Vinegar, or Juice of Lemmons, or any of the Acid Liquors I have
  yet had occa&#383;ion to try, will turn Syrrup of Violets, of a
  <i>Red</i>, (or at lea&#383;t, of a <i>Reddi&#383;h</i> Colour, &#383;o I
  have found, that not only the Volatile Salts of all Animal
  Sub&#383;tances I have us'd, as Spirit of Harts-horn, of Urine, of
  Sal-Armoniack, of Blood, &amp;c. but al&#383;o all the Alcalizate Salts I
  have imploy'd, as the Solution of Salt of Tartar, of Pot-a&#383;hes, of
  common Wood-a&#383;hes, Lime-water, &amp;c. will immediately change the
  Blew Syrrup, into a perfect Green. And by the &#383;ame way (to hint that
  upon <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248"></a>[pg
  248]</span> the by) I el&#383;ewhere &#383;how you, both the changes that
  Nature and Time produce, in the more Saline parts of &#383;ome Bodies,
  may be di&#383;cover'd, and al&#383;o how ev'n &#383;uch Chymically
  prepar'd Bodies, as belong not either to the Animal Kingdome, or to the
  Tribe of <i>Alcali's</i>, may have their new and &#383;uperinduc'd Nature
  &#383;ucce&#383;sfully Examin'd. In this place I &#383;hall only add,
  that not alone the Changing the Colour of the Syrrup, requires, that the
  Changing Body be more &#383;trong, of the Acid, or other &#383;ort of
  Salt that is Predominant in it, than is requi&#383;ite for the working
  upon the Tincture of <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>; but that in this is
  al&#383;o, the Operation of the formerly mention'd Salts upon our Syrrup,
  differs from their Operation upon our Tinctures, that in this Liquor, if
  the Cæruleous Colour be <i>De&#383;troy'd</i> by an Acid Salt, it may be
  <i>Restor'd</i> by one that is either Volatile, or Lixiviate; whereas in
  Syrrup of Violets, though one of the&#383;e contrary Salts will
  <i>destroy</i> the Action of the other, yet neither of them will
  <i>re&#383;tore</i> the Syrrup to its native Blew; but each of them will
  Change it into the Colour which it &#383;elf doth (if I may &#383;o
  &#383;peak) affect, as we &#383;hall have Occa&#383;ion to &#383;how in
  the Notes on the twenty fifth Experiment.</p>

<!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249"></a>[pg 249]</span>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXI.</i></h3>

  <p>There is a Weed, more known to Plowmen than belov'd by them,
  who&#383;e Flowers from their Colour are commonly call'd
  <i>Blew-bottles</i>, and <i>Corn-weed</i> from their Growing among Corn<a
  name="NtA_18"></a><a href="#Nt_18"><sup>18</sup></a>. The&#383;e Flowers
  &#383;ome Ladies do, upon the account of their Lovely Colour, think worth
  the being Candied, which when they are, they will long retain &#383;o
  fair a Colour, as makes them a very fine Sallad in the Winter. But I have
  try'd, that when they are fre&#383;hly gather'd, they will afford a
  Juice, which when newly expre&#383;s'd, (for in &#383;ome ca&#383;es
  'twill &#383;oon enough degenerate) affords a very deep and plea&#383;ant
  Blew. Now, (to draw this to our pre&#383;ent Scope) by dropping on this
  fre&#383;h Juice, a little Spirit of Salt, (that being the Acid Spirit I
  had then at hand) it immediately turn'd (as I predicted) into a Red. And
  if in&#383;tead of the Sowr Spirit I mingled with it a little &#383;trong
  Solution of an Alcalizate Salt, it did pre&#383;ently di&#383;clo&#383;e
  a lovely Green; the &#383;ame Changes being by tho&#383;e differing
  &#383;orts of Saline Liquors, producible in this <i>Natural juice</i>,
  that we lately mention'd to <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_250"></a>[pg 250]</span> have happen'd to that <i>factitious
  Mixture</i>, the Syrrup of Violets. And I remember, that finding this
  Blew Liquor, when fre&#383;hly made, to be capable of &#383;erving in a
  Pen for an Ink of that Colour, I attempted by moi&#383;tning one part of
  a piece of White Paper with the Spirit of Salt I have been mentioning,
  and another with &#383;ome Alcalizate or Volatile Liquor, to draw a Line
  on the lei&#383;urely dry'd Paper, that &#383;hould, e'vn before the Ink
  was dry, appear partly Blew, partly Red, and partly Green: But though the
  latter part of the Experiment &#383;ucceeded not well, (whether
  becau&#383;e Volatile Salts are too Fugitive to be retain'd in the Paper,
  and Alcalizate ones are too Unctuous, or &#383;o apt to draw
  Moi&#383;ture from the Air, that they keep the Paper from drying well)
  yet the former Part &#383;ucceeded well enough; the Blew and Red being
  Con&#383;picuous enough to afford a &#383;urprizing Spectacle to
  tho&#383;e, I acquaint not with (what I willingly allow you to call) the
  <i>Trick</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation upon the one and twentieth
Experiment.</i></p>

  <p>But le&#383;t you &#383;hould be tempted to think (<i>Pyrophilus</i>)
  that Volatile or Alcalizate <!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_251"></a>[pg 251]</span> Salts change Blews into Green, rather
  upon the &#383;core of the ea&#383;ie Tran&#383;ition of the former
  Colour into the latter, than upon the account of the Texture, wherein
  mo&#383;t Vegetables, that afford a Blew, &#383;eem, though
  otherwi&#383;e differing, to be Allied, I will add, that when I
  purpo&#383;ely di&#383;&#383;olv'd Blew Vitriol in fair Water, and
  thereby imbu'd &#383;ufficiently that Liquor with that Colour, a
  Lixiviate Liquor, and a Urinous Salt being Copiou&#383;ly pour'd upon
  di&#383;tinct Parcels of it, did each of them, though perhaps with
  &#383;ome Difference, turn the Liquor not Green, but of a deep
  Yellowi&#383;h Colour, almo&#383;t like that of Yellow Oker, which Colour
  the Precipitated Corpu&#383;cles retain'd, when they had Lei&#383;urely
  &#383;ub&#383;ided to the Bottom. What this Precipitated Sub&#383;tance
  is, it is not needfull now to Enquire in this place, and in another, I
  have &#383;hown you, that notwith&#383;tanding its Colour, and its being
  Obtainable from an Acid <i>Men&#383;truum</i> by the help of Salt of
  Tartar, it is yet far enough from being the true Sulphur of Vitriol.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXII.</i></h3>

  <p>Our next Experiment (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) will perhaps &#383;eem to be
  of a contrary Nature <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_252"></a>[pg 252]</span> to the two former, made upon Syrrup
  of Violets, and Juice of Blew-bottles. For as in them by the
  Affu&#383;ion of Oyl of Tartar, a Blewi&#383;h Liquor is made Green,
  &#383;o in this, by the &#383;ole Mixture of the &#383;ame Oyl, a
  Greeni&#383;h Liquor becomes Blew. The hint of this Experiment was given
  us by the practice of &#383;ome <i>Italian</i> Painters, who being wont
  to Counterfeit <i>Ultra-marine Azure</i> (as they call it) by Grinding
  Verdigrea&#383;e with Sal-Armoniack, and &#383;ome other Saline
  Ingredients, and letting them Rot (as they imagine) for a good while
  together in a Dunghill, we &#383;uppos'd, that the change of Colour
  wrought in the Verdigrea&#383;e by this way of Preparation, mu&#383;t
  proceed from the Action of certain Volatile and Alcalizate Salts,
  abounding in &#383;ome of the mingled Concretes, and brought to make a
  further Di&#383;&#383;olution of the Copper abounding in the
  Verdigrea&#383;e, and therefore we Conjectur'd, that if both the
  Verdigrea&#383;e, and &#383;uch Salts were di&#383;&#383;olv'd in fair
  Water, the &#383;mall Parts of both being therein more &#383;ubdivided,
  and &#383;et at liberty, would have better acce&#383;s to each other, and
  thereby Incorporate much the more &#383;uddenly; And accordingly we
  found, that if upon a &#383;trong Solution of good French
  Verdigrea&#383;e (for 'tis that we <!-- Page 253 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253"></a>[pg 253]</span> are wont to
  imploy, as the be&#383;t) you pour a ju&#383;t quantity of Oyl of Tartar,
  and &#383;hake them well together, you &#383;hall immediately &#383;ee a
  notable Change of Colour, and the Mixture will grow thick, and not
  tran&#383;parent, but if you &#383;tay a while, till the
  Gro&#383;&#383;er part be Precipitated to, and &#383;etled in the Bottom,
  you may obtain a clear Liquor of a very lovely Colour, and exceeding
  delightfull to the Eye. But, you mu&#383;t have a care to drop in a
  competent Quantity of Oyl of Tartar, for el&#383;e the Colour will not be
  &#383;o Deep, and Rich; and if in&#383;tead of this Oyl you imploy a
  clear <i>Lixivium</i> of Pot-a&#383;hes, you may have an Azure
  &#383;omewhat Lighter or Paler than, and therefore differing from, the
  former. And if in&#383;tead of either of the&#383;e Liquors, you make
  u&#383;e of Spirit of Urine, or of Harts-horn, you may according to the
  Quantity and Quality of the Spirit you pour in, obtain &#383;ome further
  Variety (though &#383;carce con&#383;iderable) of Cæruleous Liquors. And
  yet lately by the help of this Urinous Spirit we made a Blew Liquor,
  which not a few Ingenious Per&#383;ons, and among them, &#383;ome,
  who&#383;e Profe&#383;&#383;ion makes them very Conver&#383;ant with
  Colours, have looked upon with &#383;ome wonder. But the&#383;e Azure
  Colour'd Liquors <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_254"></a>[pg 254]</span> &#383;hould be freed from the
  Sub&#383;iding matter, which the Salts of Tartar or Urine precipitate out
  of them, rather by being Decanted, than by Filtration. For by the latter
  of the&#383;e ways we have &#383;ometimes found, the Colour of them very
  much Impair'd, and little Superiour to that of the gro&#383;&#383;er
  Sub&#383;tance, that it left in the Filtre.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXIII.</i></h3>

  <p>That Ro&#383;es held over the Fume of Sulphur, may quickly by it be
  depriv'd of their Colour, and have as much of their Leaves, as the Fume
  works upon, burn'd pale, is an Experiment, that divers others have tried,
  as well as I. But (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) it may &#383;eem &#383;omewhat
  &#383;trange to one that has never con&#383;ider'd the Compounded nature
  of Brim&#383;tone, That, whereas the Fume of Sulphur will, as we have
  &#383;aid, Whiten the Leaves of Ro&#383;es; That Liquor, which is
  commonly call'd Oyl of Sulphur <i>per Campanam</i>, becau&#383;e it is
  &#383;uppos'd to be made by the Conden&#383;ation of the&#383;e Fumes in
  Gla&#383;&#383;es &#383;hap't like Bells, into a Liquor, does powerfully
  heighten the Tincture of Red Ro&#383;es, and make it more Red and Vivid,
  as we have ea&#383;ily tried by putting &#383;ome Red-Ro&#383;e Leaves,
  <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255"></a>[pg
  255]</span> that had been long dried, (and &#383;o had lo&#383;t much of
  their Colour) into a Vial of fair Water. For a while after the
  Affu&#383;ion of a convenient Quantity of the Liquor we are &#383;peaking
  of, both the Leaves them&#383;elves, and the Water they were Steep'd in,
  di&#383;cover'd a very fre&#383;h and lovely Colour.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXIV.</i></h3>

  <p>It may (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) &#383;omewhat &#383;erve to
  Illu&#383;trate, not only the Doctrine of <i>Pigments</i>, and of
  <i>Colours</i>, but divers other Parts of the <i>Corpu&#383;cular
  Philo&#383;ophy</i>; as that explicates Odours, and many other things,
  not as the Schools by Aery Qualities, but by Real, though extremely
  Minute Bodies; to examine, how much of a Colourle&#383;s Liquor, a very
  &#383;mall Parcel of a Pigment may Imbue with a <i>di&#383;cernable</i>
  Colour. And though there be &#383;carce any thing of
  Preci&#383;ene&#383;s to be expected from &#383;uch Trials, yet I
  pre&#383;um'd, that (at lea&#383;t) I &#383;hould be able to &#383;how a
  much further Subdivi&#383;ion of the Parts of Matter into
  <i>Vi&#383;ible</i> Particles, than I have hitherto found taken notice
  of, and than mo&#383;t men would imagine; no Body, that I know of, having
  yet attempted to reduce this Matter to any Mea&#383;ure.</p>

<!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256"></a>[pg 256]</span>

  <p>The Bodies, the mo&#383;t promi&#383;ing for &#383;uch a purpo&#383;e,
  might &#383;eem to be the Metalls, e&#383;pecially Gold, becau&#383;e of
  the Multitude, and Minutene&#383;s of its Parts, which might be argu'd
  from the incomparable Clo&#383;ene&#383;s of its Texture: But though we
  tried a Solution of Gold made in <i>Aqua Regia</i> fir&#383;t, and then
  in fair Water; yet in regard we were to determine the Pigment we
  imploy'd, not by <i>Bulk</i> but <i>Weight</i>, and becau&#383;e
  al&#383;o, that the Yellow Colour of Gold is but a faint one in
  Compari&#383;on of the deep Colour of <i>Cochineel</i>, we rather
  cho&#383;e this to make our Trials with. But among divers of the&#383;e
  it will &#383;uffice to &#383;et down one, which was carefully made in
  Ve&#383;&#383;els conveniently Shap'd; (and that in the pre&#383;ence of
  a Witne&#383;s, and an A&#383;&#383;i&#383;tant) the Sum whereof I find
  among my <i>Adver&#383;aria</i>, Regi&#383;tred in the following Words.
  To which I &#383;hall only premi&#383;e, (to le&#383;&#383;en the wonder
  of &#383;o &#383;trange a diffu&#383;ion of the Pigment) That
  <i>Cochineel</i> will be better Di&#383;&#383;olv'd, and have its Colour
  far more heightn'd by Spirit of Urine, than (I &#383;ay not by common
  Water, but) by Rectify'd Spirit of Wine it &#383;elf.</p>

  <p>The Note I &#383;poke off is this. [One Grain of <i>Cochineel</i>
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd in a pretty Quantity of Spirit of Urine, and then
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd <!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_257"></a>[pg 257]</span> further by degrees in fair Water,
  imparted a di&#383;cernable, though but a very faint Colour, to about
  &#383;ix Gla&#383;s-fulls of Water, each of them containing about forty
  three Ounces and an half, which amounts to above a hundred twenty five
  thou&#383;and times its own Weight.]</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXV.</i></h3>

  <p>It may afford a con&#383;iderable Hint (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) to him,
  that would improve the Art of Dying, to know what change of Colours may
  be produc'd by the three &#383;everal &#383;orts of Salts already often
  mention'd, (&#383;ome or other of which may be procur'd in Quantity at
  rea&#383;onable Rates) in the Juices, Decoctions, Infu&#383;ions, and (in
  a word) the more &#383;oluble parts of Vegetables. And, though the
  de&#383;ign of this Di&#383;cour&#383;e be the Improvement of Knowledge,
  not of Trades: yet thus much I &#383;hall not &#383;cruple to intimate
  here, That the Blew Liquors, mention'd in the twentieth and one and
  twentieth Experiments, are far from being the only Vegetable
  Sub&#383;tances, upon which Acid, Urinous, and Alcalizate Salts have the
  like Operations to tho&#383;e recited in tho&#383;e two Experiments. For
  Ripe <i>Privet Berries</i> (for in&#383;tance) being cru&#383;h'd <!--
  Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258"></a>[pg 258]</span>
  upon White Paper, though they &#383;tain it with a Purpli&#383;h Colour,
  yet if we let fall on &#383;ome part of it two or three drops of Spirit
  of Salt, and on the other part a little more of the Strong Solution of
  Pot-a&#383;hes, the former Liquor immediately turn'd that part of the
  Thick juice or Pulp, on which it fell, into a lovely Red, and the latter
  turn'd the other part of it into a delightfull Green. Though I will not
  undertake, that tho&#383;e Colours in that Sub&#383;tance &#383;hall not
  be much more Orient, than La&#383;ting; and though (<i>Pyrophilus</i>)
  this Experiment may &#383;eem to be almo&#383;t the &#383;ame with
  tho&#383;e already deliver'd concerning Syrrup of Violets, and the Juice
  of Blew-bottles, yet I think it not ami&#383;s to take this Occa&#383;ion
  to inform you, that this Experiment reaches much farther, than perhaps
  you yet imagine, and may be of good U&#383;e to tho&#383;e, whom it
  concerns to know, how Dying Stuffs may be wrought upon by Saline Liquors.
  For, I have found this Experiment to &#383;ucceed in &#383;o many Various
  Berries, Flowers, Blo&#383;&#383;oms, and other finer Parts of
  Vegetables, that neither my Memory, nor my Lei&#383;ure &#383;erves me to
  enumerate them. And it is &#383;omewhat &#383;urprizing to &#383;ee, by
  how Differingly-colour'd Flowers, or Blo&#383;&#383;oms, (for example)
  the Paper being <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_259"></a>[pg 259]</span> &#383;tain'd, will by an Acid Spirit
  be immediately turn'd Red, and by any <i>Alcaly</i> or any Urinous Spirit
  turn'd Green; in&#383;omuch that ev'n the cru&#383;h'd Blo&#383;&#383;oms
  of <i>Me&#383;erion</i>, (which I gather'd in Winter and fro&#383;ty
  Weather) and tho&#383;e of Pea&#383;e, cru&#383;h'd upon White Paper, how
  remote &#383;oever their Colours be from Green, would in a moment
  pa&#383;s into a deep Degree of that Colour, upon the Touch of an
  Alcalizate Liquor. To which let us add, That either of tho&#383;e new
  Pigments (if I may &#383;o call them) may by the Affu&#383;ion of enough
  of a contrary Liquor, be pre&#383;ently chang'd from Red into Green, and
  from Green into Red, which Ob&#383;ervation will hold al&#383;o in Syrrup
  of Violets, Juices of Blew-bottles, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation.</i></p>

  <p>After what I have formerly deliver'd to evince, That there are many
  In&#383;tances, wherein new Colours are produc'd or acquir'd by Bodies,
  which <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> are wont to think de&#383;titute of Salt, or
  to who&#383;e change of Colours no new Acce&#383;&#383;ion of Saline
  Particles does appear to contribute, I think we may &#383;afely enough
  acknowledge, <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_260"></a>[pg 260]</span> that we have taken notice of &#383;o
  many Changes made by the Intervention of Salts in the Colours of Mix'd
  Bodies, that it has le&#383;&#383;en'd our Wonder, That though <i>many
  Chymi&#383;ts</i> are wont to a&#383;cribe the Colours of Such Bodies to
  their Sulphureous, and <i>the re&#383;t</i> to their Mercurial Principle;
  yet <i>Paracel&#383;us</i> him&#383;elf directs us in the Indagation of
  Colours, to have an Eye principally upon Salts, as we find in that
  pa&#383;&#383;age of his, wherein he takes upon him to Oblige his Readers
  much by In&#383;tructing them, of what things they are to expect the
  Knowledge from each of the three di&#383;tinct Principles of Bodies.
  <i>Alias</i> (&#383;ays he) <i>Colorum &#383;imilis ratio e&#383;t: De
  quibus brevem in&#383;titutionem hanc attendite, quod &#383;cilicet
  colores omnes ex Sale prodeant. Sal enim dat colorem, dat
  Bal&#383;amum.</i><a name="NtA_19"></a><a href="#Nt_19"><sup>19</sup></a>
  And a little beneath. <i> Iam natura Ip&#383;a colores protrathit ex
  &#383;ale, cuique &#383;peciei dans illum, qui ip&#383;i competit</i>,
  &amp;c. After which he concludes; <i>Itaque qui rerum omnium corpora
  cogno&#383;cere vult, huic opus e&#383;t, ut ante omnia cogno&#383;cat
  Sulphur, Ab hoc, qui de&#383;iderat novi&#383;&#383;e Colores is

  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261"></a>[pg 261]</span> prout
  natura cuilibet &#383;peciei ea inge&#383;&#383;it</i>. But though
  <i>Paracel&#383;us</i> a&#383;cribes to each of his belov'd
  Hypo&#383;tatical Principles, much more than I fear will be found to
  belong to it; yet if we plea&#383;e to con&#383;ider Colours, not as
  <i>Philo&#383;ophers</i>, but as <i>Dyers</i>, the concurrence of Salts
  to the &#383;triking and change of Colours, and their Efficacy, will, I
  &#383;uppo&#383;e, appear &#383;o con&#383;iderable, that we &#383;hall
  not need to quarrel much with <i>Paracel&#383;us</i>, for a&#383;cribing
  in this place (for I dare not affirm that he u&#383;es to be &#383;till
  of one Mind) the Colours of Bodies to their Salts, if by Salts he here
  under&#383;tood, not only Elementary Salts, but &#383;uch al&#383;o as
  are commonly taken for Salts, as Allom, Cry&#383;tals of Tartar, Vitriol,
  &amp;c. becau&#383;e the Saline principle does chiefly abound in them,
  though indeed they be, as we el&#383;ewhere declare, mix'd Bodies, and
  have mo&#383;t of them, be&#383;ides what is Saline, both Sulphureous,
  Aqueous, and Gro&#383;s or Earthy parts.</p>

  <p>But though (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) I have ob&#383;erv'd a Red and Green to
  be produc'd, the former, by Acid Salts, the later by Salts not Acid, in
  the expre&#383;s Juices of &#383;o many differing Vegetable
  Sub&#383;tances, that the Ob&#383;ervation, if per&#383;ued, may prove
  (as I &#383;aid) of good U&#383;e: yet to &#383;how you how much e'vn
  the&#383;e Effects depend upon the <!-- Page 262 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262"></a>[pg 262]</span> particular Texture
  of Bodies, I mu&#383;t &#383;ubjoyn &#383;ome ca&#383;es wherein I (who
  am &#383;omewhat backwards to admit Ob&#383;ervations for Univer&#383;al)
  had the Curio&#383;ity to di&#383;cover, that the Experiments would not
  Uniformly &#383;ucceed, and of the&#383;e Exceptions, the chief that I
  now remember, are reducible to the following three.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXVI.</i></h3>

  <p>And, (fir&#383;t) I thought fit to try the Operation of Acid Salts
  upon Vegetable Sub&#383;tances, that are already and by their own Nature
  Red. And accordingly I made Trial upon Syrrup of Clove-july-flowers, the
  clear expre&#383;s'd Juice of the &#383;ucculent Berries of <i>Spina
  Cervina</i>, or Buckthorn (which I had long kept by me for the &#383;ake
  of its deep Colour) upon Red Ro&#383;es, Infu&#383;ion of Brazil, and
  divers other Vegetable Sub&#383;tances, on &#383;ome of which
  cru&#383;h'd (as is often mention'd) upon White Paper, (which is
  al&#383;o to be under&#383;tood in mo&#383;t of the&#383;e Experiments,
  if no Circum&#383;tance of them argue otherwi&#383;e) Spirit of Salt
  either made no con&#383;iderable Change, or alter'd the Colour but from a
  Darker to a Lighter Red. How it will &#383;ucceed in many other Vegetable
  Juices, <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263"></a>[pg
  263]</span> and Infu&#383;ions of the &#383;ame Colour, I have at
  pre&#383;ent &#383;o few at hand, that I mu&#383;t leave you to find it
  out your &#383;elf. But as for the Operation of the other &#383;orts of
  Salts upon the&#383;e Red Sub&#383;tances, I found it not very Uniform,
  &#383;ome Red, or Reddi&#383;h Infu&#383;ions, as of Ro&#383;es, being
  turn'd thereby into a dirty Colour, but yet inclining to Green. Nor was
  the Syrrup of Clove-july-flowers turn'd by the &#383;olution of
  Pot-a&#383;hes to a much better, though &#383;omewhat a Greener, Colour.
  Another &#383;ort of Red Infu&#383;ions was by an <i>Alcaly</i> not
  turn'd into a Green, but advanc'd into a Crim&#383;on, as I &#383;hall
  have occa&#383;ion to note ere long. But there were other &#383;orts, as
  particularly the lovely Colour'd juice of Buckthorn Berries, that readily
  pa&#383;s'd into a lovely Green.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXVII.</i></h3>

  <p>Among other Vegetables, which we thought likely to afford Exceptions
  to the General Ob&#383;ervation about the differing Changes of Colours
  produc'd by Acid and Sulphureous Salts, we thought fit to make Trial upon
  the Flowers of <i>Ja&#383;min</i>, they being both White as to Colour,
  and e&#383;teem'd to be of a more Oyly nature than other Flowers.
  Whereupon having taken <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_264"></a>[pg 264]</span> the White parts only of the Flowers,
  and rubb'd them &#383;omewhat hard with my Finger upon a piece of clean
  Paper, it appear'd very little Di&#383;colour'd. Nor had Spirit of Salt,
  wherewith I moi&#383;ten'd one part of it, any con&#383;iderable
  Operation upon it. But Spirit of Urine, and &#383;omewhat more
  effectually a &#383;trong Alcalizate Solution, did immediately turn the
  almo&#383;t Colourle&#383;s Paper moi&#383;ten'd by the Juice of the
  <i>Ja&#383;min</i>, not as tho&#383;e Liquors are wont to do, when put
  upon the Juices of other Flowers, of a good Green, but of a Deep, though
  &#383;omewhat Greeni&#383;h Yellow, which Experiment I did afterwards at
  &#383;everal times repeat with the like &#383;ucce&#383;s. But it
  &#383;eems not that a great degree of Unctuou&#383;ne&#383;s is
  nece&#383;&#383;ary to the Production of the like Effects, for when we
  try'd the Experiment with the Leaves of tho&#383;e purely White Flowers
  that appear about the end of Winter, and are commonly call'd <i>Snow
  drops</i>, the event, was not much unlike that, which, we have been newly
  mentioning.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXVIII.</i></h3>

  <p>Another &#383;ort of In&#383;tances to &#383;how, how much changes of
  Colour effected by Salts, depend upon the particular Texture of the <!--
  Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265"></a>[pg 265]</span>
  Colour'd Bodies, has been afforded me by &#383;everal <i>Yellow</i>
  Flowers, and other Vegetables, as Mary-gold Leaves, early
  Prim-ro&#383;es, fre&#383;h Madder, &amp;c. For being rubb'd upon White
  Paper, till they imbued it with their Colour, I found not, that by the
  addition of Alcalizate Liquors, nor yet by that of an Urinous Spirit,
  they would be turn'd either Green or Red: nor did &#383;o Acid a Spirit,
  as that of Salt, con&#383;iderably alter their Colour, &#383;ave that it
  &#383;eem'd a little to Dilute it. Only in &#383;ome early
  Prim-ro&#383;es it de&#383;troy'd the greate&#383;t part of the Colour,
  and made the Paper almo&#383;t White agen. And Madder al&#383;o afforded
  &#383;ome thing peculiar, and very differing from what we have newly
  mention'd: For having gather'd Some Roots of it, and, (whil&#383;t they
  were recent) expre&#383;s'd upon White Paper the Yellow Juice, an
  Alcalizate Solution drop'd upon it did not turn it either Green or White,
  but Red. And the bruis'd Madder it &#383;elf being drench'd with the like
  Alcalizate Solution, exchang'd al&#383;o its Yellowi&#383;hne&#383;s for
  a Redne&#383;s.</p>

  <p>Having thus (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) given you divers In&#383;tances, to
  countenance the General ob&#383;ervation deliver'd in the twenty fifth
  Experiment, and divers Exceptions whereby it ought to be Limited; I
  mu&#383;t leave the further Inquiry into the&#383;e Matters to your own
  Indu&#383;try. For not remembring at pre&#383;ent many of tho&#383;e
  other Trials, long &#383;ince made to &#383;atisfie my &#383;elf about
  Particulars, and not having now the Opportunity to repeat them, I
  mu&#383;t content my Self to have given you the Hint, and the ways of
  pro&#383;ecuting the &#383;earch your Self; and only declare to you in
  general, that, As I have made many Trials, unmention'd in this
  Treati&#383;e, who&#383;e Events were agreeable to tho&#383;e mention'd
  in the twenty fifth Experiment, &#383;o (to name now no other
  In&#383;tances) what I have try'd with Acid and Sulphureous Salts upon
  the Pulp of Juniper Berries, rubb'd upon White Paper, inclines me to
  think, That among that va&#383;t Multitude, and &#383;trange Variety of
  Plants that adorn the face of the Earth, perhaps many other Vegetables
  may be found, on which &#383;uch <i>Men&#383;truums</i> may not <!-- Page
  267 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267"></a>[pg 267]</span> have
  &#383;uch Operations, as upon the Juice of Violets,
  Pea&#383;e-blo&#383;&#383;oms, &amp;c. no nor upon any of tho&#383;e
  three other &#383;orts of Vegetables, that I have taken notice of in the
  three fore-going Experiments. It &#383;ufficiently appearing ev'n by
  the&#383;e, that the effects of a Salt upon the Juices of particular
  Vegetables do very much depend upon their particular Textures.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXIX.</i></h3>

  <p>It may be of &#383;ome U&#383;e towards the di&#383;covery of the
  nature of the&#383;e Changes, which the Alimental Juice receives in
  &#383;ome Vegetables, according to the differing degrees of their
  Maturity, and according to the differing kinds of Plants of the &#383;ame
  Denomination, to ob&#383;erve what Operation Acid, Urinous, and
  Alcalizate Salts will have upon the Juices of the &#383;everal &#383;orts
  of the Vegetable &#383;ub&#383;tances I have been mentioning.</p>

  <p>To declare my meaning by an Example, I took from the &#383;ame
  Clu&#383;ter, one Blackberry full Ripe, and another that had not yet gone
  beyond a Redne&#383;s, and rubbing apiece of white Paper, with the
  former, I ob&#383;erv'd, that the Juice adhering to it was of adark
  Reddi&#383;h Colour, full of little <!-- Page 268 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268"></a>[pg 268]</span> Black Specks; and
  that this Juice by a drop of a &#383;trong <i>Lixivium</i>, was
  immediately turn'd into a Greeni&#383;h Colour deep enough, by as much
  Urinous Spirit into a Colour much of Kin to the former, though
  &#383;omewhat differing, and fainter; and by a drop of Spirit of Salt
  into a fine and light&#383;ome Red: where as the Red Berry being in like
  manner rubb'd upon Paper, left on it a Red Colour, which was very little
  alter'd by the Acid Spirit newly nam'd, and by the Urinous and Lixiviate
  Salts receiv'd changes of Colour differing from tho&#383;e that had been
  ju&#383;t before produc'd in the dark Juice of the Ripe Blackberry.</p>

  <p>I remember al&#383;o, that though the Infu&#383;ion of
  Damask-Ro&#383;es would as well, though not &#383;o much, as that of Red,
  be heightned by Acid Spirits to an inten&#383;e degree of Redne&#383;s,
  and by Lixiviate Salts be brought to a Darki&#383;h Green; yet having for
  Trials &#383;ake taken a Ro&#383;e, who&#383;e Leaves, which were large
  and numerous, like tho&#383;e of a Province Ro&#383;e, were perfectly
  Yellow, though in a Solution of Salt of Tartar, they afforded a Green
  Blewi&#383;h Tincture, yet I did not by an Acid Liquor obtain a Red one;
  all that the Saline Spirit I imploy'd, perform'd, being (if I much
  mi&#383;remember <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_269"></a>[pg 269]</span> not) to Dilute Somewhat the
  Yellowne&#383;s of the Leaves. I would al&#383;o have tried the Tincture
  of Yellow Violets, but could procure none. And if I were in tho&#383;e
  I&#383;lands of <i>Banda</i>, which are made Famous as well as Rich, by
  being the almo&#383;t only places, where Cloves will pro&#383;per, I
  &#383;hould think it worth my Curio&#383;ity to try, what Operation the
  three differing Kinds of Salts, I have &#383;o often mention'd, would
  have upon the Juice of this Spice, (expre&#383;s'd at the &#383;everal
  Sea&#383;ons of it) as it grows upon the Tree. Since good Authors inform
  us, (of what is remarkable) that the&#383;e whether Fruits, or Rudiments
  of Fruits, are at fir&#383;t <i>White</i>, afterward <i>Green</i>, and
  then <i>Reddi&#383;h</i>, before they be beaten off the Tree, after which
  being Dry'd before they are put up, they grow <i>Blacki&#383;h</i> as we
  &#383;ee them. And one of the recente&#383;t <i>Herbari&#383;ts</i>
  informs us, that the Flower grows upon the top of the Clove it &#383;elf,
  con&#383;i&#383;ting of four &#383;mall Leaves, like a Cherry
  Blo&#383;&#383;om, but of an excellent <i>Blew</i>. But
  (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) to return to our own Ob&#383;ervations, I &#383;hall
  add, that I the rather choo&#383;e, to mention to you an Example drawn
  from Ro&#383;es, becau&#383;e that though I am apt to think, as I
  el&#383;ewhere adverti&#383;e, that &#383;omething may be gue&#383;s'd at
  about <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270"></a>[pg
  270]</span> &#383;ome of the Qualities of the Juices of Vegetables, by
  the Re&#383;emblance or Di&#383;parity that we meet with in the Changes
  made of their Colours, by the Operation of the &#383;ame kinds of Salts;
  yet that tho&#383;e Conjectures &#383;hould be very warily made, may
  appear among other things, by the In&#383;tance I have cho&#383;en to
  give in Ro&#383;es. For though, (as I formerly told you) the Dry'd
  Leaves, both of the Damask, and of Red ones, give a Red Tincture to Water
  &#383;harpen'd with Acid Salts, yet the one &#383;ort of Leaves is known
  to have a Purgative faculty,<a name="NtA_20"></a><a
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>20</sup></a> and the other are often, and divers ways,
  imploy'd for Binding.</p>

  <p>And I al&#383;o choo&#383;e (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) to &#383;ubjoyn this
  twenty ninth Experiment to tho&#383;e that precede it, about the change
  of the Colours of Vegetables by Salts, for the&#383;e two rea&#383;ons:
  The fir&#383;t, that you may not ea&#383;ily entertain Su&#383;pitions,
  if in the Trials of an Experiment of &#383;ome of the Kinds formerly
  mention'd, you &#383;hould meet with an Event &#383;omewhat differing
  from what my Relations may have made you expect. And the &#383;econd,
  That you may hereby be invited to di&#383;cern, that it may not be
  ami&#383;s to take notice of the particular Sea&#383;ons wherein you
  gather the Vegetables which <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_271"></a>[pg 271]</span> in Nicer Experiments you make
  u&#383;e of. For, it I were not hindred both by ha&#383;te and &#383;ome
  ju&#383;tifiable Con&#383;iderations, I could perhaps add
  con&#383;iderable In&#383;tances, to tho&#383;e lately deliver'd, for the
  making out of this Ob&#383;ervation; but for certain rea&#383;ons I
  &#383;hall at pre&#383;ent &#383;ub&#383;titute a remarkable
  pa&#383;&#383;age to be met with in that Laborious Herbari&#383;t Mr.
  <i>Parkin&#383;on</i>, where treating of the Virtues of the (already
  divers times mention'd) Buckthorn Berries, he &#383;ubjoyns the following
  account of &#383;everal Pigments that are made of them, not only
  according to the &#383;everal ways of Handling them, but according to the
  differing Sea&#383;ons of Maturity, at which they are Gather'd; <i>Of
  the&#383;e Berries</i>, (&#383;ays he) <i>are made three &#383;everal
  &#383;orts of Colours as they &#383;hall be gather'd, that is, being
  gather'd while they are Green, and kept Dry, are call'd Sapberries, which
  being &#383;teep'd into &#383;ome Allom-water, or fre&#383;h bruis'd into
  Allom-water, they give a rea&#383;onable fair Yellow Colour which
  Painters u&#383;e for their Work, and Book-binders to Colour the edges of
  Books, and Leather-dre&#383;&#383;ers to Colour Leather, as they u&#383;e
  al&#383;o to make a Green Colour, call'd Sap-green, taken from the
  Berries when they are Black, being bruis'd and put into a Bra&#383;s or
  Copper Kettle or Pan, and there &#383;uffer'd to abide three or four</i>
  <!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272"></a>[pg
  272]</span> <i>Days, or a little heated upon the Fire, and &#383;ome
  beaten Allom put unto them, and afterwards pre&#383;s'd forth, the Juice
  or Liquor is u&#383;ually put in great Bladders tied with &#383;trong
  thred at the Head and hung up untill it be Dry, which is
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd in Water or Wine, but Sack</i> (he affirms) <i>is the
  be&#383;t to pre&#383;erve the Colour from Starving, (as they call it)
  that is, from Decaying, and make it hold fre&#383;h the longer. The third
  Colour (where of none</i> (&#383;ays he) <i>that I can find have made
  mention but only</i> Tragus<i>) is a Purpli&#383;h Colour, which is made
  of the Berries &#383;uffer'd to grow upon the Bu&#383;hes untill the
  middle or end of</i> November, <i>that they are ready to drop from the
  Trees.</i></p>

  <p>And, I remember (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) that I try'd, with a
  &#383;ucce&#383;s that pleas'd me well enough, to make &#383;uch a kind
  of Pigment, as Painters call Sap-green, by a way not unlike that,
  deliver'd here by our Author, but I cannot now find any thing relating to
  that matter among my loo&#383;e Papers. And my Trials were made &#383;o
  many years ago, that I dare not tru&#383;t my Memory for
  Circum&#383;tances, but will rather tell you, that in a noted
  Colour-&#383;hop, I brought them by Que&#383;tions to confe&#383;s to me,
  that they made their Sap-green much after the ways by our
  <i>Botani&#383;t</i> here mention'd. And on this occa&#383;ion <!-- Page
  273 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273"></a>[pg 273]</span> I
  &#383;hall add an Ob&#383;ervation, which though it does not
  &#383;trictly belong to this place, may well enough be mention'd here,
  namely, that I find by an account given us by the Learned
  <i>Clu&#383;ius</i>, of <i>Alaternus</i>, that ev'n the Gro&#383;&#383;er
  Parts of the &#383;ame Plant, are &#383;ome of them one Colour, and
  &#383;ome another; For &#383;peaking of that Plant, he tells us, that the
  <i>Portugalls</i> u&#383;e the Bark to Dye their Nets into a Red Colour,
  and with the Chips of the Wood, which are Whiti&#383;h, they Dye a
  Blacki&#383;h Blew.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXX.</i></h3>

  <p>Among the Experiments that tend to &#383;hew that the change of
  Colours in Bodies may proceed from the Vary'd Texture of their Parts, and
  the con&#383;equent change of their Di&#383;po&#383;ition to Reflect or
  Refract the Light, that &#383;ort of Experiments mu&#383;t not be left
  unmention'd, which is afforded us by Chymical Dige&#383;tions. For, if
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> will believe &#383;everal famous Writers about what
  they call the Philo&#383;ophers Stone, they mu&#383;t acknowledge that
  the &#383;ame Matter, &#383;eald up Hermetically in a Philo&#383;ophical
  Egg, will by the continuance of Dige&#383;tion, or if they will have it
  &#383;o (for it is not Material in our ca&#383;e which of the two it be)
  <!-- Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274"></a>[pg
  274]</span> of Decoction, run through a great Variety of differing
  Colours, before it come to that of the Noble&#383;t <i>Elixir</i>;
  whether that be Scarlet, or Purple, or what ever other Kind of Red. But
  without building any thing on &#383;o Obtru&#383;e and Que&#383;tionable
  an Operation, (which yet may be pertinently repre&#383;ented to
  tho&#383;e that believe the thing) we may ob&#383;erve, that divers
  Bodies dige&#383;ted in carefully-clos'd Ve&#383;&#383;els, will in tract
  of time, change their Colour: As I have el&#383;ewhere mention'd my
  having ob&#383;erv'd ev'n in Rectify'd Spirit of Harts-horn, and as is
  evident in the Precipitations of Amalgams of Gold, and Mercury, without
  Addition, where by the continuance of a due Heat the Silver-Colour'd
  Amalgam is reduc'd into a &#383;hining Red Powder. Further In&#383;tances
  of this Kind you may find here and there in divers places of my other
  E&#383;&#383;ays. And indeed it has been a thing, that has much
  contributed to deceive many <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i>, that there are more
  Bodies than one, which by Dige&#383;tion will be brought to exhibit that
  Variety and Succe&#383;&#383;ion of Colours, which they imagine to be
  Peculiar to what they call the <i>True matter of the
  Philo&#383;ophers</i>. But concerning this, I &#383;hall referr you to
  what you may el&#383;ewhere find in the Di&#383;cour&#383;e written
  touching the <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_275"></a>[pg 275]</span> pa&#383;&#383;ive Deceptions of
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i>, and more about the Production of Colours by
  Dige&#383;tion you will meet with pre&#383;ently. Wherefore I &#383;hall
  now make only this Ob&#383;ervation from what has been deliver'd, That in
  the&#383;e Operations there appears not any cau&#383;e to attribute the
  new Colours emergent to the Action of a new Sub&#383;tantial form, nor to
  any Increa&#383;e or Decrement of either the Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury of
  the Matter that acquires new Colours: For the Ve&#383;&#383;els are
  clos'd, and the&#383;e Principles according to the <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i>
  are Ingenerable and Incorruptible; &#383;o that the Effect &#383;eems to
  proceed from hence, that the Heat agitating and &#383;huffling the
  Corpu&#383;cles of the Body expos'd to it, does in proce&#383;s of time
  &#383;o change its Texture, as that the Tran&#383;po&#383;ed parts do
  Modifie the incident Light otherwi&#383;e, than they did when the Matter
  appear'd of another Colour.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXXI.</i></h3>

  <p>Among the &#383;everal changes of Colour, which Bodies acquire or
  di&#383;clo&#383;e by Dige&#383;tion, it it very remarkable, that
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> find a Redne&#383;s rather than any other Colour in
  mo&#383;t of the Tinctures they Draw, and ev'n in the more Gro&#383;s
  Solutions they <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_276"></a>[pg 276]</span> make of almo&#383;t all Concretes,
  that abound either with Mineral or Vegetable Sulphur, though the
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i> imploy'd about the&#383;e Solutions or Tinctures be
  never &#383;o Limpid or Colourle&#383;s.</p>

  <p>This we have ob&#383;erv'd in I know not how many Tinctures drawn with
  Spirit of Wine from <i>Jalap</i>, <i>Guaicum</i>, and &#383;everal other
  Vegetables; and not only in the Solutions of <i>Amber</i>,
  <i>Benzoin</i>, and divers other Concretes made with the &#383;ame
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, but al&#383;o in divers Mineral Tinctures. And,
  not to urge that familiar In&#383;tance of the Ruby of Sulphur, as
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> upon the &#383;core of its Colour, call the Solution
  of Flowers of Brim&#383;tone, made with the Spirit of Turpentine, nor to
  take notice of other more known Examples of the aptne&#383;s of Chymical
  Oyls, to produce a Red Colour with the Sulphur they extract, or
  di&#383;&#383;olve; not to in&#383;i&#383;t (I &#383;ay) upon
  In&#383;tances of this nature, I &#383;hall further repre&#383;ent to
  you, as a thing remarkable, that, both Acid and Alcalizate Salts, though
  in mo&#383;t other ca&#383;es of &#383;uch contrary Operations, in
  reference to Colours, will with many Bodies that abound with Sulphureous,
  or with Oyly parts, produce a Red; as is manife&#383;t partly in the more
  Vulgar In&#383;tances of the Tinctures, or Solutions of <!-- Page 277
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277"></a>[pg 277]</span> Sulphur
  made with <i>Lixiviums</i>, either of Calcin'd Tartar or Pot-a&#383;hes,
  and other Obvious examples, partly by this, that the true Gla&#383;s of
  Antimony extracted with &#383;ome Acid Spirits, with or without Wine,
  will yield a Red Tincture, and that I know an Acid Liquor, which in a
  moment will turn Oyl of Turpentine into a deep Red. But among the many
  In&#383;tances I could give you of the ea&#383;ie Production of
  Redne&#383;s by the Operation of Saline Spirit, as well as of Spirit of
  Wine; I remember two or three of tho&#383;e I have tried, which &#383;eem
  remarkable enough to de&#383;erve to be mention'd to you apart.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXXII.</i></h3>

  <p>But before we &#383;et them down, it will not perhaps appear
  impertinent to premi&#383;e;</p>

  <p>That there &#383;eems to be a manife&#383;t Di&#383;parity betwixt Red
  Liquors, &#383;o that &#383;ome of them may be &#383;aid to have a
  Genuine Redne&#383;s in compari&#383;on of others, that have a
  Yellowi&#383;h Redne&#383;s: For if you take (for example) a good
  Tincture of <i>Chochineel</i>, dilute it never &#383;o much with fair
  Water, you will not (as far as I can judge by what I have tried) be able
  to make it a Yellow Liquor. In&#383;omuch that a Single <!-- Page 278
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278"></a>[pg 278]</span> drop of a
  rich Solution of <i>Cochineel</i> in Spirit of Urine, being Diluted with
  above an Ounce of fair Water, exhibited no Yellowi&#383;hne&#383;s at
  all, but a fair (though &#383;omewhat faint) Pinck or Carnation; and even
  when <i>Cochineel</i> was by degrees Diluted much beyond the newly
  mention'd Colour, by the way formerly related to you in the twenty fourth
  Experiment, I remember not, that there appear'd in the whole Trial any
  Yellow. But if you take Bal&#383;om of Sulphur (for In&#383;tance) though
  it may appear in a Gla&#383;s, where it has a good Thickne&#383;s, to be
  of a deep Red, yet if you &#383;hake the Gla&#383;s, or pour a few drops
  on a &#383;heet of White Paper, &#383;preading them on it with your
  Finger, the Bal&#383;om that falls back along the &#383;ides of the
  Gla&#383;s, and that which &#383;tains the Paper, will appear Yellow, not
  Red. And there are divers Tinctures, &#383;uch as that of Amber made with
  Spirit of Wine, (to name now no more) that will appear either Yellow or
  Red, according as the Ve&#383;&#383;els that they fill, are Slender or
  Broad.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXXIII.</i></h3>

  <p>But to proceed to the Experiments I was about to deliver;
  <i>Fir&#383;t</i>; Oyl or Spirit <!-- Page 279 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279"></a>[pg 279]</span> of Turpentine,
  though clear as fair Water, being Dige&#383;ted upon the purely White
  Sugar of Lead, has, in a &#383;hort time, afforded us a high Red
  Tincture, that &#383;ome Arti&#383;ts are pleas'd to call the Bal&#383;om
  of <i>Saturn</i>, which they very much (and probably not altogether
  without cau&#383;e) extoll as an excellent Medicine in divers Outward
  affections.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXXIV.</i></h3>

  <p><i>Next</i>, take of common Brim&#383;tone finely powdred five Ounces,
  of Sal-Armoniack likewi&#383;e pulveriz'd an equal weight, of beaten
  Quick-lime &#383;ix Ounces, mix the&#383;e Powders exqui&#383;itely, and
  Di&#383;till them through a Retort plac'd in Sand by degrees of Fire,
  giving at length as inten&#383;e a Heat as you well can in Sand, there
  will come over (if you have wrought well) a Volatile Tincture of Sulphur,
  which may probably prove an excellent Medicine, and &#383;hould have been
  mention'd among the other Preparations of Sulphur, which we have
  el&#383;ewhere imparted to you, but that it is very pertinent to our
  pre&#383;ent Subject, The change of Colours. For though none of the
  Ingredients be Red, the Di&#383;till'd Liquor will be &#383;o: and this
  Liquor if it <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_280"></a>[pg 280]</span> be well Drawn, will upon a little
  Agitation of the Vial fir&#383;t un&#383;top'd (e&#383;pecially if it be
  held in a Warmer hand) lend forth a copious Fume, not Red, like that of
  Nitre, but White; And &#383;ometimes this Liquor may be &#383;o Drawn,
  that I remember, not long &#383;ince, I took plea&#383;ure to
  ob&#383;erve in a parcel of it, that Ingredients not Red, did not only
  yield by Di&#383;tillation a Volatile Spirit that was Red, but though
  that Liquor did upon the bare opening of the Bottle it was kept in, drive
  us away with the plenty and &#383;ulphureous &#383;ent of a White
  &#383;team which it &#383;ent forth, yet the Liquor it &#383;elf being
  touch'd by our Fingers, did immediately Dye them Black.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXXV.</i></h3>

  <p>The third and <i>la&#383;t</i> Experiment I &#383;hall now mention to
  &#383;hew, how prone Bodies abounding in Sulphureous parts are to afford
  a Red Colour, is one, wherein by the Operation of a Saline Spirit upon a
  White or Whiti&#383;h Body, which according to the <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i>
  &#383;hould be altogether Sulphureous, a Redne&#383;s may be produc'd,
  not (as in the former Experiments) &#383;lowly, but in the twinkling of
  an Eye. We took then of the E&#383;&#383;ential Oyl of Anni&#383;eeds,

  lo&#383;es its Fluidity and the greate&#383;t part of its
  Tran&#383;parency, and looks like a White or Whiti&#383;h Oyntment, and
  near at hand &#383;eems to con&#383;i&#383;t of a Multitude of little
  &#383;oft Scales: Of this Coagulated Stuff we &#383;pread a little with a
  Knife upon a piece of White Paper, and letting fall on it, and mixing
  with it a drop or two of Oyl of Vitriol, immediately (as we
  fore-&#383;aw) there emerg'd together with &#383;ome Heat and Smoak, a
  Blood-Red Colour, which therefore was in a trice produc'd by two Bodies,
  whereof the one had but a Whiti&#383;h Colour, and the other (if
  carefully rectify'd) had no Colour at all.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXXVI.</i></h3>

  <p>But on this Occa&#383;ion (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) we mu&#383;t add once
  for all, that in many of the above-recited Experiments, though the
  changes of Colour happen'd as we have mention'd them: yet the emergent or
  produc'd Colour is oft times very &#383;ubject to Degenerate, both
  quickly and much. Notwith&#383;tanding which, &#383;ince the Changes, we
  have &#383;et down, do happen pre&#383;ently upon the Operation of the
  Bodies upon each other, or at the times by us &#383;pecify'd; <!-- Page
  282 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282"></a>[pg 282]</span>
  <i>that</i> is &#383;ufficient both to ju&#383;tifie our Veracity, and to
  &#383;hew what we Intend; it not being E&#383;&#383;ential to the
  Genuinene&#383;s of a Colour to be Durable. For a fading Leaf, that is
  ready to Rot, and moulder into Du&#383;t, may have as true a Yellow, as a
  Wedge of Gold, which &#383;o ob&#383;tinately re&#383;i&#383;ts both Time
  and Fire. And the rea&#383;on, why I take occa&#383;ion from the former
  Experiment to &#383;ubjoyn this general Adverti&#383;ement, is, that I
  have &#383;everal times ob&#383;erv'd, that the Mixture re&#383;ulting
  from the Oyls of Vitriol, and of Anni&#383;eeds, though it acquire a
  thicker con&#383;i&#383;tence than either of the Ingredients had, has
  quickly lo&#383;t its Colour, turning in a very &#383;hort time into a
  dirty Gray, at lea&#383;t in the Superficial parts, where 'tis expos'd to
  the Air; which la&#383;t Circum&#383;tance I therefore mention,
  becau&#383;e that, though it &#383;eem probable, that this Degeneration
  of Colours may oft times and in divers ca&#383;es proceed from the
  further Action of the Saline Corpu&#383;cles, and the other Ingredients
  upon one another, yet in many ca&#383;es much of the Quick change of
  Colours &#383;eems a&#383;cribeable to the Air, as may be made probable
  by &#383;everal rea&#383;ons: The fir&#383;t whereof may be fetcht from
  the newly recited Example of the two Oyls; The next may be, that we have
  &#383;ometimes ob&#383;erv'd <!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_283"></a>[pg 283]</span> long Window-Curtains of light
  Colours, to have that part of them, which was expos'd to the Air, when
  the Window was open, of one Colour, and the lower part, that was
  &#383;heltred from the Air by the Wall, of another Colour: And the third
  Argument may be fetch'd from divers Ob&#383;ervations, both of others,
  and our own; For of that Pigment &#383;o well known in Painters Shops, by
  the name of <i>Turn&#383;ol</i>, our Indu&#383;trious
  <i>Parkin&#383;on</i>, in the particular account he gives of the Plant
  that bears it, tells us al&#383;o, That <i>the Berries when they are at
  their full Maturity, have within them between the outer Skin and the
  inward Kirnel or Seed, a certain Juice or Moi&#383;ture, which being
  rubb'd upon Paper or Cloath, at the first appears of a fre&#383;h and
  lovely Green Colour, but pre&#383;ently changeth into a kind of
  Blewi&#383;h Purple, upon the Cloath or Paper, and the &#383;ame Cloath
  afterwards wet in Water, and wrung forth, will Colour the Water into a
  Claret Wine Colour, and the&#383;e</i> (concludes he) <i>are tho&#383;e
  Raggs of Cloath, which are u&#383;ually call'd</i> Turn&#383;ol <i>in the
  Druggi&#383;ts or Grocers Shops</i><a name="NtA_21"></a><a
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>21</sup></a>. And to this Ob&#383;ervation of our
  <i>Botanist</i> we will add an Experiment of our own, (made before we met
  with That) which, though in many Circum&#383;tances, very <!-- Page 284
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284"></a>[pg 284]</span>
  differing, &#383;erves to prove the &#383;ame thing; for having taken of
  the deeply Red Juice of <i>Buckthorn</i> Berries, which I bought of the
  Man that u&#383;es to &#383;ell it to the Apothecaries, to make their
  Syrrup <i>de Spina Cervina</i>, I let &#383;ome of it drop upon a piece
  of White Paper, and having left it there for many hours, till the Paper
  was grown dry again, I found what I was inclin'd to &#383;u&#383;pect,
  namely, That this Juice was degenerated from a deep Red to a dirty kind
  of Greyi&#383;h Colour, which, in a great part of the &#383;tain'd Paper
  &#383;eem'd not to have &#383;o much as an Eye of Red: Though a little
  Spirit of Salt or di&#383;&#383;olv'd <i>Alcaly</i> would turn this
  unplea&#383;ant Colour (as formerly I told you it would change the not
  yet alter'd Juice) into a Red or Green. And to &#383;atisfie my
  &#383;elf, that this Degeneration of Colour did not proceed from the
  Paper, I drop'd &#383;ome of the deep Red or Crim&#383;on Juice upon a
  White glaz'd Tile, and &#383;uffering it to dry on there, I found that
  ev'n in that Body, on which it could not Soak, and by which it could not
  be Wrought, it neverthele&#383;s lo&#383;t its Colour. And the&#383;e
  In&#383;tances (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) I am the more carefull to mention to
  you, that you may not be much Surpris'd or Di&#383;courag'd, if you
  &#383;hould &#383;ometimes mi&#383;s of performing <!-- Page 285 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285"></a>[pg 285]</span> punctually what I
  affirm my &#383;elf to have done in point of changing Colours; &#383;ince
  in the&#383;e Experiments the over-&#383;ight or neglect of &#383;uch
  little Circum&#383;tances, as in many others would not be perhaps
  con&#383;iderable, may occa&#383;ion the mis-carrying of a Trial. And I
  was willing al&#383;o to take this occa&#383;ion of Adverti&#383;ing you
  in the repeating of the Experiments mention'd in this Treati&#383;e, to
  make u&#383;e of the Juices of Vegetables, and other things prepar'd for
  your Trials, as &#383;oon as ever they are ready, le&#383;t one or other
  of them grow le&#383;s fit, if not quite unfit by delay; and to
  e&#383;timate the Event of the Trials by the Change, that is produc'd
  pre&#383;ently upon the due and &#383;ufficient Application of Actives to
  Pa&#383;&#383;ives, (as they &#383;peak) becau&#383;e in many ca&#383;es
  the effects of &#383;uch Mixtures may not be la&#383;ting, and the newly
  produc'd Colour may in a little time degenerate. But, (<i>Pyrophilus</i>)
  I forgot to add to the two former Ob&#383;ervations lately made about
  Vegetables, a third of the &#383;ame Import, made in Mineral
  &#383;ub&#383;tances, by telling you, That the better to &#383;atisfie a
  Friend or two in this particular, I &#383;ometimes made, according to
  &#383;ome Conjectures of mine, this Experiment; That having
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd good Silver in <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, and Precipitated
  it with Spirit of Salt, upon <!-- Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_286"></a>[pg 286]</span> the fir&#383;t Decanting of the
  Liquor, the remaining Matter would be purely White; but after it had lain
  a while uncover'd, that part of it, that was Contiguous to the Air, would
  not only lo&#383;e its Whitene&#383;s, but appear of a very Dark and
  almo&#383;t Blacki&#383;h Colour, I &#383;ay that part that was
  Contiguous to the Air, becau&#383;e if that were gently taken off, the
  Subjacent part of the &#383;ame Ma&#383;s would appear very White, till
  that al&#383;o, having continu'd a while expos'd to the Air, would
  likewi&#383;e Degenerate. Now whether the Air perform the&#383;e things
  by the means of a Subtile Salt, which we el&#383;ewhere &#383;how it not
  to be de&#383;titute of, or by a peircing Moi&#383;ture, that is apt
  ea&#383;ily to in&#383;inuate it &#383;elf into the Pores of &#383;ome
  Bodies, and thereby change their Texture, and &#383;o their Colour; Or by
  &#383;olliciting the Avolation of certain parts of the Bodies, to which
  'tis Contiguous; or by &#383;ome other way, (which po&#383;&#383;ibly I
  may el&#383;ewhere propo&#383;e and con&#383;ider) I have not now the
  lei&#383;ure to di&#383;cour&#383;e. And for the &#383;ame rea&#383;on,
  though I could add many other In&#383;tances, of what I formerly noted
  touching the emergency of Redne&#383;s upon the Dige&#383;tion of many
  Bodies, in&#383;omuch that I have often &#383;een upon the Borders of
  <i>France</i> (and probably we may have the like in <!-- Page 287
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287"></a>[pg 287]</span>
  <i>England</i>) a &#383;ort of Pears, which dige&#383;ted for &#383;ome
  time with a little Wine, in a Ve&#383;&#383;el exactly clos'd, will in
  not many hours appear throughout of a deep Red Colour, (as al&#383;o that
  of the Juice, wherein they are Stew'd, becomes) but ev'n on pure and
  white Salt of Tartar, pure Spirit of Wine, as clear as Rock-water, will
  (as we el&#383;ewhere declare) by long Dige&#383;tion acquire a
  Redne&#383;s; Though I &#383;ay &#383;uch In&#383;tances might be
  Multiply'd, and though there be &#383;ome other Obvious changes of
  Colours, which happen &#383;o frequently, that they cannot but be as well
  Con&#383;iderable as Notorious; &#383;uch as is the Blackne&#383;s of
  almo&#383;t all Bodies burn'd in the open Air: yet our ha&#383;te invites
  us to re&#383;ign you the Exerci&#383;e of enquiring into the Cau&#383;es
  of the&#383;e Changes. And certainly, the rea&#383;on both <i>why</i> the
  Soots of &#383;uch differing Bodies are almo&#383;t all of them all
  Black, <i>why</i> &#383;o much the greater part of Vegetables &#383;hould
  be rather Green than of any other Colour, and particularly (which more
  directly concerns this place) <i>why</i> gentle Heats do &#383;o
  frequently in Chymical Operations produce rather a Redne&#383;s than
  another Colour in dige&#383;ted <i>Men&#383;truums</i>, not only
  Sulphureous, as Spirit of Wine, but Saline, as Spirit of Vinegar, may be
  very well worth <!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_288"></a>[pg 288]</span> a &#383;erious Inquiry; which I
  &#383;hall therefore recommend to <i>Pyrophilus</i> and his Ingenious
  Friends.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXXVII.</i></h3>

  <p>It may &#383;eem &#383;omewhat &#383;trange, that if you take the
  Crim&#383;on Solution of <i>Cochineel</i>, or the Juice of Black
  Cherries, and of &#383;ome other Vegetables that afford the like Colour,
  (which becau&#383;e many take but for a deep Red, we do with them
  &#383;ometimes call it &#383;o) and let &#383;ome of it fall upon a piece
  of Paper, a drop or two of an Acid Spirit, &#383;uch as Spirit of Salt,
  or <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, will immediately turn it into a fair Red. Whereas
  if you make an Infu&#383;ion of Brazil in fair Water, and drop a little
  Spirit of Salt or <i>Aqua-fortis</i> into it, that will de&#383;troy its
  Redne&#383;s, and leave the Liquor of a Yellow, (&#383;ometimes Pale) I
  might perhaps plau&#383;ibly enough &#383;ay on this occa&#383;ion, that
  if we con&#383;ider the ca&#383;e a little more attentively, we may take
  notice, that the action of the Acid Spirit &#383;eems in both ca&#383;es,
  but to weaken the Colour of the Liquor on which it falls. And &#383;o
  though it de&#383;troy Redne&#383;s in the Tincture of Brazil, as well as
  produce Red in the Tincture of <i>Chochineel</i>, its Operations may be
  Uniform <!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289"></a>[pg
  289]</span> enough, &#383;ince as Crim&#383;on &#383;eems to be little
  el&#383;e than a very deep Red, with (perhaps) an Eye of Blew, &#383;o
  &#383;ome kinds of Red &#383;eem (as I have lately noted) to be little
  el&#383;e than heightned Yellow. And con&#383;equently in &#383;uch
  Bodies, the Yellow &#383;eems to be but a diluted Red. And accordingly
  Alcalizate Solutions and Urinous Spirits, which &#383;eem di&#383;pos'd
  to Deepen the Colours of the Juices and Liquors of mo&#383;t Vegetables,
  will not only re&#383;tore the Solution of <i>Cochineel</i> and the
  Infu&#383;ion of Brazil to the Crim&#383;on, whence the Spirit of Salt
  had chang'd them into a truer Red; but will al&#383;o (as I lately told
  you) not only heighthen the Yellow Juice of Madder into Red, but advance
  the Red Infu&#383;ion of Brazil to a Crim&#383;on. But I know not whether
  it will not be much &#383;afer to derive the&#383;e Changes from vary'd
  Textures, than certain kinds of Bodies; and you will perhaps think it
  worth while, that I &#383;hould add on this occa&#383;ion, That it may
  de&#383;erve &#383;ome Speculation, why, notwith&#383;tanding what we
  have been ob&#383;erving, though Blew and Purple &#383;eem to be deeper
  Colours than Red, and therefore the Juices of Plants of either of the two
  former Colours may (congruou&#383;ly enough to what has been ju&#383;t
  now noted) be turn'd Red by <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_290"></a>[pg 290]</span> Spirit of Salt or <i>Aqua-fortis</i>,
  yet Blew Syrrup of Violets and &#383;ome Purples &#383;hould both by Oyl
  of Tartar and Spirit of Urine be chang'd into Green, which &#383;eems to
  be not a deeper but a more diluted Colour than Blew, if not al&#383;o
  than Purple.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXXVIII.</i></h3>

  <p>It would much contribute to the Hi&#383;tory of Colours, if
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> would in their Laboratories take a heedfull notice,
  and give us a faithfull account of the Colours ob&#383;erv'd in the
  Steams of Bodies either Sublim'd or Di&#383;till'd, and of the Colours of
  tho&#383;e Productions of the Fire, that are made up by the Coalition of
  tho&#383;e Steams. As (for In&#383;tance) we ob&#383;erve in the
  Di&#383;tilling of pure Salt peter, that at a certain &#383;ea&#383;on of
  the Operation, the Body, though it &#383;eem either Cry&#383;talline, or
  White, affords very Red Fumes: whereas though Vitriol be Green or Blew,
  the Spirit of it is ob&#383;erv'd to come over in Whiti&#383;h Fumes. The
  like Colour I have taken notice of in the Fumes of &#383;everal other
  Concretes of differing Colours, and Natures, e&#383;pecially when
  Di&#383;till'd with &#383;trong Fires. And we el&#383;ewhere note, that
  ev'n Soot, as Black as it is, has fill'd our Receivers <!-- Page 291
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291"></a>[pg 291]</span> with
  &#383;uch copious White Fumes, that they &#383;eem'd to have had their
  In-&#383;ides wa&#383;h'd with Milk. And no le&#383;s ob&#383;ervable may
  be, the Di&#383;till'd Liqours, into which &#383;uch Fumes convene, (for
  though we will not deny, that by skill and care a Reddi&#383;h Liqour may
  be obtain'd from Nitre) yet the common Spirit of it, in the making ev'n
  of which &#383;tore of the&#383;e Red Fumes are wont to pa&#383;s over
  into the Receiver, appears not to be at all Red. And be&#383;ides, that
  neither the Spirit of Vitriol, nor that of Soot is any thing White; And,
  be&#383;ides al&#383;o, that as far as I have ob&#383;erv'd, mo&#383;t
  (for I &#383;ay not all) of the Empyreumatical Oyls of Woods, and other
  Concretes, are either of a deep Red, or of a Colour between Red and
  Black; be&#383;ides this, I &#383;ay, 'tis very remarkable that
  notwith&#383;tanding that great Variety of Colours to be met with in the
  Herbs, Flowers, and other Bodies wont to be Di&#383;till'd in
  <i>Balneo</i>: yet (as far at lea&#383;t as our common Di&#383;tillers
  Experience reacheth) all the Waters and Spirits that fir&#383;t come over
  by that way of Di&#383;tillation, leave the Colours of their Concretes
  behind them, though indeed there be one or two Vegetables not commonly
  taken notice of, who&#383;e Di&#383;till'd Liqours I el&#383;ewhere
  ob&#383;erve to carry over <!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_292"></a>[pg 292]</span> the Tincture of the Concrete with
  them. And as in Di&#383;tillations, &#383;o in Sublimations, it were
  worth while to take notice of what comes up, in reference to our
  pre&#383;ent &#383;cope, by purpo&#383;ely performing them (as I have in
  &#383;ome cafes done) in conveniently &#383;hap'd Gla&#383;&#383;es, that
  the Colour of the a&#383;cending Fumes may be di&#383;cern'd; For it may
  afford a Naturali&#383;t good Information to ob&#383;erve the Congruities
  or the Differences betwixt the Colours of the a&#383;cending Fumes, and
  tho&#383;e of the <i>Flowers</i>, they compo&#383;e by their Convention.
  For it is evident, that the&#383;e <i>Flowers</i>, do many of them in
  point of Colour, much differ, not only from one another, but oft times
  from the Concretes that afforded them. Thus, (not here to repeat what I
  formerly noted of the Black Soots of very differingly Colour'd Bodies)
  though Camphire and Brim&#383;tone afford <i>Flowers</i> much of their
  own Colour, &#383;ave that tho&#383;e of Brim&#383;tone are wont to be a
  little Paler, than the Lumps that yielded them; yet ev'n of Red
  <i>Benzoin</i>, that &#383;ublim'd Sub&#383;tance, which
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> call its <i>Flowers</i>, is wont to be White or
  Whiti&#383;h. And to omit other In&#383;tances, ev'n one and the
  &#383;ame Black Mineral, Antimony, may be made to afford <i>Flowers</i>,
  &#383;ome of them Red, and &#383;ome Grey, and, which is more
  &#383;trange, <!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_293"></a>[pg 293]</span> &#383;ome of them purely White. And
  'tis the Pre&#383;cription of &#383;ome Gla&#383;s-men by
  exqui&#383;itely mingling a convenient proportion of Brim&#383;tone,
  Sal-Armoniack, and Quick&#383;ilver, and Subliming them, together, to
  make a Sublimate of an excellent Blew; and though having caus'd the
  Experiment to be made, we found the produc'd Sublimate to be far from
  being of a lovely Colour, (as was promis'd) that there and there, it
  &#383;eem'd Blewi&#383;h, and at lea&#383;t was of a Colour differing
  enough from either of the Ingredients, which is &#383;ufficient for our
  pre&#383;ent purpo&#383;e. But a much finer Colour is promis'd by
  &#383;ome of the Empiricks, that pretend to Secrets, who tell us, that
  Orpiment, being Sublim'd, will afford among the Parts of it that fly
  Upward, &#383;ome little Ma&#383;&#383;es, which, though the Mineral it
  &#383;elf be of a good Yellow, will be Red enough to emulate Rubies, both
  in Colour and Tran&#383;lucency. And this Experiment may, for ought I
  know, &#383;ometimes &#383;ucceed; for I remember, that having in a
  &#383;mall Bolt-head purpo&#383;ely &#383;ublim'd &#383;ome powder'd
  Orpiment, we could in the Lower part of the Sublimate di&#383;cern here
  and there &#383;ome Reddi&#383;h Lines, though much of the Upper part of
  the Sublimate con&#383;i&#383;ted of a matter, which was not alone purely
  <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294"></a>[pg
  294]</span> Yellow, but tran&#383;parent almo&#383;t like a Powder. And
  we have al&#383;o this way obtain'd a Sublimate, the Lower part whereof
  though it con&#383;i&#383;ted not of Rubies, yet the &#383;mall pieces of
  it, which were Numerous enough, were of a plea&#383;ant Reddi&#383;h
  Colour, and Glitter'd very prettily. But to in&#383;i&#383;t on &#383;uch
  kind of Trials and Ob&#383;ervations (where the a&#383;cending Fumes of
  Bodies differ in Colour from the Bodies them&#383;elves) though it might
  indeed Inrich the Hi&#383;tory of Colours, would Robb me of too much of
  the little time I have to di&#383;patch what I have further to tell you
  concerning them.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XXXIX</i></h3>

  <p>Take the dry'd Buds (or Blo&#383;&#383;oms) of the Pomegranate Tree,
  (which are commonly call'd in the Shops <i>Balau&#383;tiums</i>) pull off
  the Reddi&#383;h Leaves, and by a gentle Ebullition of them in fair
  Water, or by a competent Infu&#383;ion of them in like Water well heated,
  extract a faint Reddi&#383;h Tincture, which if the Liquor be turbid, you
  may Clarifie it by Filtrating it Into this, if you pour a little good
  Spirit of Urine, or &#383;ome other Spirit abounding in the like
  &#383;ort of Volatile Salts, the Mixture will <!-- Page 295 --><span

  little rectify'd Spirit of Sea-Salt, the Pale and almo&#383;t
  Colourle&#383;s Liquor will immediately not only grow more
  Tran&#383;parent, but acquire a high Redne&#383;s, like that of Rich
  Claret Wine, which &#383;o &#383;uddenly acquir'd Colour, may as quickly
  be De&#383;troy'd and turn'd into a dirty Blewi&#383;h Green, by the
  affu&#383;ion of a competent quantity of the above-mention'd Spirit of
  Urine.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation.</i></p>

  <p>This Experiment may bring &#383;ome Light to, and receive &#383;ome
  from a couple of other Experiments, that I remember I have met with in
  the ingenious <i>Ga&#383;&#383;endus</i>'s Animadver&#383;ions upon
  <i>Epicurus</i>'s Philo&#383;ophy, whil&#383;t I was turning over the
  Leaves of tho&#383;e Learned Commentaries; (my Eyes being too weak to let
  me read &#383;uch Voluminous Books quite thorough) And I the le&#383;s
  &#383;cruple (notwith&#383;tanding my contrary Cu&#383;tom in this
  Treati&#383;e) to &#383;et down the&#383;e Experiments of another,
  becau&#383;e I &#383;hall a little improve the latter of them, and
  becau&#383;e by comparing there with that which I have la&#383;t recited,
  we may be a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted to Conjecture <!-- Page 296 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296"></a>[pg 296]</span> upon what account
  it is, that Oyl of Vitriol heightens the Tincture of Red-ro&#383;e
  Leaves, &#383;ince Spirit of Salt, which is a highly Acid
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, but otherwi&#383;e differing enough from Oyl of
  Vitriol, does the &#383;ame thing. Our Authors Experiments then, as we
  made them, are the&#383;e; We took about a Gla&#383;s-full of luke-warm
  Water, and in it immerg'd a quantity of the Leaves of <i>Senna</i>, and
  pre&#383;ently upon the Immer&#383;ion there did not appear any
  Redne&#383;s in the Water, but dropping into it a little Oyl of Tartar,
  the Liquor &#383;oon di&#383;cover'd a Redne&#383;s to the watchfull Eye,
  whereas by a little of that Acid Liquor of Vitriol, which is like the
  former, unde&#383;ervedly called Oyl, &#383;uch a Colour would not be
  extracted from the infu&#383;ed <i>Senna</i>. On the other &#383;ide we
  took &#383;ome Red-ro&#383;e Leaves dry'd, and having &#383;haken them
  into a Gla&#383;s of fair Water, they imparted to it no Redne&#383;s, but
  upon the affu&#383;ion of a little Oyl of Vitriol the Water was
  immediately turn'd Red, which it would not have been, if in&#383;tead of
  Oyl of Vitriol, we had imployed Oyl of Tartar to produce that Colour:
  That the&#383;e were <i>Ga&#383;&#383;endus</i> his Experiments, I partly
  remember, and was a&#383;&#383;ur'd by a Friend, who lately
  Tran&#383;cribed them out of <i>Ga&#383;&#383;endus</i> his Book, which I
  <!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297"></a>[pg
  297]</span> therefore add, becau&#383;e I have not now that Book at hand.
  And the de&#383;ign of <i>Ga&#383;&#383;endus</i> in the&#383;e
  Experiments our Friend affirms to be, to prove, that of things not Red a
  Redne&#383;s may be made only by Mixture, and the Varied po&#383;ition of
  parts, wherein the Doctrine of that Subtil Philo&#383;opher doth not a
  little Authorize, what we have formerly delivered concerning the
  Emergency and Change of Colours. But the in&#383;tances, that we have out
  of him &#383;et down, &#383;eem not to be the mo&#383;t Eminent, that may
  be produced of this truth: For our next Experiment will &#383;hew the
  production of &#383;everal Colours out of Liquors, which have not any of
  them any &#383;uch Colour, nor indeed any di&#383;cernable one at all;
  and whereas though our Author tells us, that there was no Redne&#383;s
  either in the Water, or the Leaves of <i>Senna</i>, or the Oyl of Tartar;
  And though it be true, that the Predominant Colour of the Leaves of
  <i>Senna</i> be another than Red, yet we have try'd, that by
  &#383;teeping that Plant a Night even in Cold water, it would afford a
  very deep Yellow or Reddi&#383;h Tincture without the help of the Oyl of
  Tartar, which &#383;eems to do little more than a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t the
  Water to extract more nimbly a plenty of that Red Tincture, wherewith the
  Leaves of <i>Senna</i> <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_298"></a>[pg 298]</span> do of them&#383;elves abound, and
  having taken off the Tincture of <i>Senna</i>, made only with fair Water,
  before it grew to be Reddi&#383;h, and Decanted it from the Leaves, we
  could not perceive, that by dropping &#383;ome Oyl of Tartar into it,
  that Colour was con&#383;iderable, though it were a little heightned into
  a Redne&#383;s; which might have been expected, if the particles of the
  Oyl did eminently Co-operate, otherwi&#383;e than we have
  expre&#383;&#383;ed, to the production of this Redne&#383;s.</p>

  <p>And as for the Experiment with Red-ro&#383;e Leaves, the &#383;ame
  thing may be alleged, for we found that &#383;uch Leaves by bare
  Infu&#383;ion for a Night and Day in fair Water, did afford us a Tincture
  bordering at lea&#383;t upon Redne&#383;s, and that Colour being
  con&#383;picuous in the Leaves them&#383;elves, would not by &#383;ome
  &#383;eem &#383;o much to be produc'd as to be extracted by the
  affu&#383;ion of Oyl of Vitriol. And the Experiment try'd with the dry'd
  Leaves of Damask-ro&#383;es &#383;ucceeded but imperfectly, but that is
  indeed ob&#383;ervable to our Authors purpo&#383;e, that Oyl of Tartar
  will not perform in this Experiment what Oyl of Vitriol doth; but
  becau&#383;e this la&#383;t named Liquor is not &#383;o ea&#383;ily to be
  had, give me leave to Adverti&#383;e you, that the Experiment will
  &#383;ucceed, <!-- Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_299"></a>[pg 299]</span> if in&#383;tead of it you imploy
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i>. And though &#383;ome Trials of our own formerly made,
  and others ea&#383;ily deducible from what we have already deliver'd,
  about the different Families and Operations of Salt, might enable us to
  pre&#383;ent you an Experiment upon Red-ro&#383;e Leaves, more
  accommodated to our Authors purpo&#383;e, than that which he hath given
  us; yet our Reverence to &#383;o Candid a Philo&#383;opher, invites us
  rather to improve his Experiment, than &#383;ub&#383;titute another in
  its place. Take therefore of the Tincture of Red-ro&#383;e Leaves, (for
  with Damask-ro&#383;e Leaves the Experiment &#383;ucceedeth not well)
  made as before hath been taught with a little Oyl of Vitriol, and a good
  quantity of fair Water, pour off this Liquor into a clear Vial, half
  fill'd with Limpid water; till the Water held again&#383;t the Light have
  acquir'd a competent Redne&#383;s, without lo&#383;ing its
  Tran&#383;parency, into this Tincture drop lei&#383;urely a little good
  Spirit of Urine, and &#383;haking the Vial, which you mu&#383;t
  &#383;till hold again&#383;t the Light, you &#383;hall &#383;ee the Red
  Liquor immediately turn'd into a fine Greeni&#383;h Blew, which Colour
  was not to be found in any of the Bodies, upon who&#383;e Mixture it
  emerg'd, and this Change is the more ob&#383;ervable, becau&#383;e in
  many Bodies <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_300"></a>[pg 300]</span> the Degenerating of Blew into Red is
  u&#383;ual enough, but the turning of Red into Blew is very unfrequent.
  If at every drop of Spirit of Urine you &#383;hake the Vial containing
  the Red Tincture, you may delightfully ob&#383;erve a pretty variety of
  Colours in the pa&#383;&#383;age of that Tincture from a Red to a Blew,
  and &#383;ometimes we have this way hit upon &#383;uch a Liquor, as being
  look't upon again&#383;t and from the Light, did &#383;eem faintly to
  emulate the above-mention'd Tincture of <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>. And if
  you make the Tincture of Red-ro&#383;es very high, and without Diluting
  it with fair Water, pour on the Spirit of Urine, you may have a Blew
  &#383;o deep, as to make the Liquor Opacous, but being dropt upon White
  Paper the Colour will &#383;oon di&#383;clo&#383;e it &#383;elf.
  Al&#383;o having made the Red, and con&#383;equently the Blew Tincture
  very Tran&#383;parent, and &#383;uffer'd it to re&#383;t in a &#383;mall
  open Vial for a Day or two, we found according to our Conjecture, that
  not only the Blew but the Red Colour al&#383;o was Vani&#383;h'd; the
  clear Liquor being of a bright Amber Colour, at the bottom of which
  &#383;ub&#383;ided a Light, but Copious feculency of almo&#383;t the
  &#383;ame Colour, which &#383;eems to be nothing but the Tincted parts of
  the Ro&#383;e Leaves drawn out by the Acid <!-- Page 301 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301"></a>[pg 301]</span> Spirits of the Oyl
  of Vitriol, and Precipitated by the Volatile Salt of the Spirit of Urine,
  which makes it the more probable, that the Redne&#383;s drawn by the Oyl
  of Vitriol, was at lea&#383;t as well an extraction of the Tinging parts
  of the Ro&#383;es, as a production of Redne&#383;s; and la&#383;tly, if
  you be de&#383;titute of Spirit of Urine, you may change the Colour of
  the Tincture of Ro&#383;es with many other Sulphureous Salts, as a
  &#383;trong Solution of Pot-a&#383;hes, Oyl of Tartar, &amp;c. which yet
  are &#383;eldome &#383;o free from Feculency, as the Spirituous parts of
  Urine becomes by repeated Di&#383;tillation.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation</i>.</p>

  <p>On this, occa&#383;ion, I call to mind, that I found, a way of
  producing, though not the &#383;ame kind of Blew, as I have been
  mentioning, yet a Colour near of Kin to it, namely, a fair Purple, by
  imploying a Liquor not made Red by Art, in&#383;tead of the Tincture of
  Red-ro&#383;es, made with an Acid Spirit; And my way was only to take
  Log-wood, (a Wood very well known to Dyers) having by Infu&#383;ion the
  Powder of it a while in fair Water made that Liquor Red, I dropt into it
  a <i>Tantillum</i> of an Urinous Spirit, as that of Sal-Armoniack, <!--
  Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302"></a>[pg 302]</span>
  (and I have done the &#383;ame thing with an <i>Alcali</i>) by which the
  Colour was in a moment turn'd into a Rich, and lovely Purple. But care
  mu&#383;t be had, that you let not fall into a Spoonfull above two or
  three Drops, le&#383;t the Colour become &#383;o deep, as to make the
  Liquor too Opacous. And (to an&#383;wer the other part of
  <i>Ga&#383;&#383;endus</i> his Experiment) if in&#383;tead of fair Water,
  I infus'd the Log-wood in Water made &#383;omewhat &#383;owr by the Acid
  Spirit of Salt, I &#383;hould obtain neither a Purple Liquor, nor a Red,
  but only a Yellow one.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XL.</i></h3>

  <p>The Experiment I am now to mention to you, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, is that
  which both you, and all the other <i>Virtuo&#383;i</i> that have
  &#383;een it, have been pleas'd to think very &#383;trange; and indeed of
  all the Experiments of Colours, I have yet met with, it &#383;eems to be
  the fitte&#383;t to recommend the Doctrine propos'd in this
  Treati&#383;e, and to &#383;hew that we need not &#383;uppo&#383;e, that
  all Colours mu&#383;t nece&#383;&#383;arily be Inherent Qualities,
  flowing from the Sub&#383;tantial Forms of the Bodies they are &#383;aid
  to belong to, &#383;ince by a bare Mechanical change of Texture in the
  Minute parts of Bodies; two Colours may in <!-- Page 303 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303"></a>[pg 303]</span> a moment be
  Generated quite <i>De novo,</i> and utterly De&#383;troy'd. For there is
  this difference betwixt the following Experiment, and mo&#383;t of the
  others deliver'd in the&#383;e Papers, that in this, the Colour that a
  Body already had, is not chang'd into another, but betwixt two Bodies,
  each of them apart devoid of Colour, there is in a moment generated a
  very deep Colour, and which if it were let alone, would be permanent; and
  yet by a very &#383;mall Parcel of a third Body, that has no Colour of
  its own, (le&#383;t &#383;ome may pretend I know not what Antipathy
  betwixt Colours) this otherwi&#383;e permanent Colour will be in another
  trice &#383;o quite De&#383;troy'd, that there will remain no
  foot-&#383;tepts either of it or of any other Colour in the whole
  Mixture.</p>

  <p>The Experiment is very ea&#383;ie, and it is thus perform'd: Take good
  common Sublimate, and fully &#383;atiate with it what quantity of Water
  you plea&#383;e, Filtre the Solution carefully through clean and
  clo&#383;e Paper, that it may drop down as Clear and Colourle&#383;s as
  Fountain water. Then when you'l &#383;hew the Experiment, put of it about
  a Spoonfull into a &#383;mall Wine-gla&#383;s, or any other convenient
  Ve&#383;&#383;el made of clear Gla&#383;s, and droping in three or four
  <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304"></a>[pg
  304]</span> drops of good Oyl of Tartar, <i>per Deliquium</i>; well
  Filtred that it may likewi&#383;e be without Colour, the&#383;e two
  Limpid Liquors will in the twinkling of an Eye turn into an Opacous
  mixture of a deep Orange Colour, which by keeping the Gla&#383;s
  continually &#383;haking in your hand, you mu&#383;t pre&#383;erve from
  &#383;etling too &#383;oon to the Bottom; And when the Spectators have a
  little beheld this fir&#383;t Change, then you mu&#383;t pre&#383;ently
  drop in about four or five drops of Oyl of Vitriol, and continuing to
  &#383;hake the Gla&#383;s pretty &#383;trongly, that it may the Nimbler
  diffu&#383;e it &#383;elf, the whole Colour, if you have gone Skilfully
  to work, will immediately di&#383;appear, and all the Liquor in the
  Gla&#383;s will be Clear and Colourle&#383;s as before, without &#383;o
  much as a Sediment at the Bottom. But for the more gracefull Trial of
  this Experiment, 'twill not be ami&#383;s to ob&#383;erve, Fir&#383;t,
  That there &#383;hould not be taken too much of the Solution of
  Sublimate, nor too much of the Oyl of Tartar drop'd in, to avoid the
  nece&#383;&#383;ity of putting in &#383;o much Oyl of Vitriol as may make
  an Ebullition, and perhaps run over the Gla&#383;s. Secondly, That 'tis
  convenient to keep the Gla&#383;s always a little &#383;haking, both for
  the better mixing of the Liquors, and to keep the Yellow Sub&#383;tance
  from Sub&#383;iding, which <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_305"></a>[pg 305]</span> el&#383;e it would in a &#383;hort
  time do, though when 'tis &#383;ub&#383;ided it will retain its Colour,
  and al&#383;o be capable of being depriv'd of it by the Oyl newly
  mention'd. Thirdly, That if any Yellow matter &#383;tick at the
  &#383;ides of the Gla&#383;s, 'tis but inclining the Gla&#383;s, till the
  clarify'd Liquor can wa&#383;h along&#383;t it, and the Liquor will
  pre&#383;ently imbibe it, and deprive it of its Colour.</p>

  <p>Many have &#383;omewhat wondred, how I came to light upon this
  Experiment, but the Notions or Conjectures I have about the differing
  Natures of the Several Tribes of Salts, having led me to devi&#383;e the
  Experiment, it will not be difficult for me to give you the Chymical
  Rea&#383;on, if I may &#383;o &#383;peak, of the <i>Phænomenon</i>.
  Having then ob&#383;erv'd, that <i>Mercury</i> being di&#383;&#383;olv'd
  in Some <i>Men&#383;truums</i>, would yield a dark Yellow Precipitate,
  and &#383;uppo&#383;ing that, as to this, common Water, and the Salts
  that &#383;tick to the <i>Mercury</i> would be equivalent to tho&#383;e
  Acid <i>Men&#383;truums</i>, which work upon the
  <i>Quick-&#383;ilver</i>, upon the account of their Saline particles, I
  &#383;ub&#383;tituted a Solution of Sublimate in fair Water, in&#383;tead
  of a Solution of <i>Mercury</i> in <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, or Spirit of
  <i>Nitre</i>, that &#383;imple Solution being both clearer and free from
  that very offen&#383;ive Smell, which accompanies the Solutions <!-- Page
  306 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306"></a>[pg 306]</span> of
  <i>Mercury</i> made with tho&#383;e other corro&#383;ive Liquors; then I
  con&#383;ider'd, that That, which makes the Yellow Colour, is indeed but
  a Precipitate made by the means of the Oyl of Tartar, which we drop in,
  and which, as <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> know, does generally precipitate
  Metalline Bodies corroded by Acid Salts; &#383;o that the Colour in our
  ca&#383;e re&#383;ults from the Coalition of the Mercurial particles with
  the Saline ones, wherewith they were formerly a&#383;&#383;ociated, and
  with the Alcalizate particles of the Salt of Tartar that &#383;wim up and
  down in the Oyl. Wherefore con&#383;idering al&#383;o, that very many of
  the effects of Lixiviate Liquors, upon the Solutions of other Bodies, may
  be de&#383;troy'd by Acid <i>Menstruums</i>, as I el&#383;ewhere more
  particularly declare, I concluded, that if I cho&#383;e a very potently
  Acid Liquor, which by its Inci&#383;ive power might undo the work of the
  Oyl of Tartar, and di&#383;per&#383;e again tho&#383;e Particles, which
  the other had by Precipitation a&#383;&#383;ociated, into &#383;uch
  minute Corpu&#383;cles as were before &#383;ingly Incon&#383;picuous,
  they would become Incon&#383;picuous again, and con&#383;equently leave
  the Liquor as Colourle&#383;s as before the Precipitation was made.</p>

  <p>This, as I &#383;aid, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, &#383;eems to be the Chymical
  rea&#383;on of this Experiment, that <!-- Page 307 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307"></a>[pg 307]</span> is &#383;uch a
  rea&#383;on, as, &#383;uppo&#383;ing the truth of tho&#383;e Chymical
  Notions I have el&#383;ewhere I hope evinc'd, may give &#383;uch an
  account of the <i>Phænomena</i> as Chymical Notions can &#383;upply us
  with; but I both here and el&#383;ewhere make u&#383;e of this way of
  &#383;peaking, to intimate that I am &#383;ufficiently aware of the
  difference betwixt a Chymical Explication of a <i>Phænomenon</i>, and one
  that is truly Philo&#383;ophical or Mechanical; as in our pre&#383;ent
  ca&#383;e, I tell you &#383;omething, when I tell you that the
  Yellowne&#383;s of the Mercurial Solution and the Oyl of Tartar is
  produc'd by the Precipitation occa&#383;ion'd by the affu&#383;ion of the
  latter of tho&#383;e Liquors, and that the de&#383;truction of the Colour
  proceeds from the Di&#383;&#383;ipation of that Curdl'd matter,
  who&#383;e Texture is de&#383;troy'd, and which is di&#383;&#383;olv'd
  into Minute and Invi&#383;ible particles by the potently Acid
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, which is the rea&#383;on, why there remains no
  Sediment in the Bottom, becau&#383;e the infu&#383;ed Oyl takes it up,
  and re&#383;olves it into hidden or invi&#383;ible Parts, as Water does
  Salt or Sugar. But when I have told you all this, I am far from thinking
  I have told all that &#383;uch an Inqui&#383;itive Per&#383;on as your
  &#383;elf would know, for I pre&#383;ume you would de&#383;ire as well as
  I to learn (at lea&#383;t) why the Particles of the <!-- Page 308
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308"></a>[pg 308]</span>
  <i>Mercury</i>, of the Tartar, and of the Acid Salts convening together,
  &#383;hould make rather an Orange Colour than a Red, or a Blew, or a
  Green, for 'tis not enough to &#383;ay what I related a little before,
  that divers Mercurial Solutions, though otherwi&#383;e made, would yield
  a Yellow precipitate, becau&#383;e the Que&#383;tion will recurr
  concerning them; and to give it a &#383;atisfactory an&#383;wer, is, I
  freely acknowledge, more than I dare as yet pretend to.</p>

  <p>But to confirm my conjecture about the Chymical rea&#383;on of our
  Experiment, I may add, that as I have (<i>viz.</i> pag. 34<sup>th</sup>.
  of this Treati&#383;e) el&#383;ewhere (on another occa&#383;ion) told
  you, with Saline Liquors of another kind and nature than Salt of Tartar,
  (namely, with Spirit of Urine, and Liquors of kin to that) I can make the
  <i>Mercury</i> precipitate out of the fir&#383;t &#383;imple Solution
  quite of another Colour than that hitherto mention'd; Nay, if
  in&#383;tead of altering the Precipitating liquor, I alter'd the Texture
  of the Sublimate in &#383;uch a way as my Notions about Salt requir'd, I
  could produce the &#383;ame <i>Phænomenon</i>. For having purpo&#383;ely
  Sublim'd together Equal parts (or thereabout) of Sal-Armoniack and
  Sublimate, fir&#383;t diligently Mix'd, the a&#383;cending Flowers being
  diffolv'd in fair Water, <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_309"></a>[pg 309]</span> and Filtred, gave a Solution Limpid
  and Colourle&#383;s, like that of the other Sublimates, and yet an
  <i>Akaly</i> drop'd into this Liquor did not turn it Yellow but White.
  And upon the &#383;ame Grounds we may with <i>Quick-&#383;ilver</i>,
  without the help of common Sublimate, prepare another &#383;ort of
  Flowers di&#383;&#383;oluble in Water without Di&#383;colouring it, with
  which I could likewi&#383;e do what I newly mention'd; to which I
  &#383;hall add, (what po&#383;&#383;ibly you'l &#383;omewhat wonder at)
  That &#383;o much does the Colour depend upon the Texture re&#383;ulting
  from the Convention of the &#383;everal &#383;orts of Corpu&#383;cles,
  that though in out Experiment, Oyl of Vitriol de&#383;troys the Yellow
  Colour, yet with <i>Quick-&#383;ilver</i> and fair Water, by the help of
  Oyl of Vitriol alone, we may ea&#383;ily make a kind of Precipitate of a
  fair and permanent Yellow, as you will e're long (in the forty
  &#383;econd Expement of this third Part) be taught. And I may further
  add, that I cho&#383;e Oyl of Vitriol, not &#383;o much for any other or
  peculiar Quality, as for its being, when 'tis well rectify'd, (which 'tis
  &#383;omewhat hazardous to bring it to be) not only devoid of Colour and
  in Smells, but extremely Strong and Inci&#383;ive; For though common and
  undephlegmated <i>Aqua-fortis</i> will not perform <!-- Page 310 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310"></a>[pg 310]</span> the &#383;ame
  thing well, yet that which is made exceeding Strong by being carefully
  Dephlegm'd, will do it pretty well, though not &#383;o well as Oyl of
  Vitriol which is &#383;o Strong, that even without Rectification it may
  for a need be made u&#383;e of. I will not here tell you what I have
  try'd, that I may be able to deprive at plea&#383;ure the Precipitate
  that one of the Sulphureous Liquors had made, by the copious
  Affu&#383;ion of the other: Becau&#383;e I found, though this Experiment
  is too tickli&#383;h to let me give a full account of it in few words, I
  &#383;hall therefore tell you, that it is not only for once, that the
  other above-mention'd Experiment may be made, the &#383;ame Numerical
  parcels of Liquor being &#383;till imploy'd in it; for after I have
  Clarify'd the Orange Colour'd Liquor, by the addition of as little of the
  Oyl of Viriol as will &#383;uffice to perform the effect, I can again at
  plea&#383;ure re-produce the Opacous Colour, by the dropping in of
  fre&#383;h Oyl of Tartar, and de&#383;troy it again by the
  Re-affu&#383;ion of more of the Acid <i>Men&#383;truum</i>; and yet
  oftner if I plea&#383;e, can I with the&#383;e two contrariant Liquors
  recall and di&#383;per&#383;e the Colour, though by rea&#383;on of the
  addition of &#383;o much new Liquor, in reference to the Mercurial
  particles, the Colour will at length appear more dilute and faint. <!--

<p class="center"><i>An improvement of the fortieth Experiment</i>.</p>

  <p>And, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, to confirm yet further the Notions that led me
  to think on the propos'd Experiment, I &#383;hall acquaint you with
  another, which when I had conveniency I have &#383;ometimes added to it,
  and which has to the Spectators appear'd little le&#383;s Odd than the
  fir&#383;t; And though becau&#383;e the Liquor, requi&#383;ite to make
  the Trial &#383;ucceed well, mu&#383;t be on purpo&#383;e prepar'd anew a
  while before, becau&#383;e it will not long retain its fitne&#383;s for
  this work, I do but &#383;eldome annex this Experiment to the other, yet
  I &#383;hall tell you how I devis'd it, and how I make it. If you boyl
  Crude Antimony in a &#383;trong and clear <i>Lixivium</i>, you &#383;hall
  &#383;eparate a Sub&#383;tance from it, which &#383;ome Modern
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> are pleas'd to call its Sulphur, but how
  de&#383;ervedly I &#383;hall not here examine, having el&#383;ewhere done
  it in an Opportune place; wherefore I &#383;hall now but need to take
  notice, that when this &#383;uppos'd Sulphur (not now to call it rather a
  kind of <i>Crocus</i>) is let fall by the Liquor upon its Refrigeration,
  it often &#383;ettles in Flakes, or &#383;uch like parcels of a Yellow
  Sub&#383;tance, (which being by the precedent <!-- Page 312 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312"></a>[pg 312]</span>
  di&#383;&#383;olution reduc'd into Minute parts, may peradventure be made
  to take Fire much more ea&#383;ily than the Gro&#383;&#383;er Powder of
  unprepar'd Antimony would have done.) Con&#383;idering therefore, that
  common Sulphur boyl'd in a <i>Lixivium</i> may be Precipitated out of it
  by Rheni&#383;h-wine or White-wine, which are Sowri&#383;h Liquors, and
  have in them, as I el&#383;ewhere &#383;hew, an Acid Salt; and having
  found al&#383;o by Trial, that with other Acid Liquors I could
  Precipitate out of Lixiviate Solvents &#383;ome other Mineral concretions
  abounding with Sulphureous parts, of which &#383;ort is crude Antimony, I
  concluded it to be ea&#383;ie to Precipitate the Antimony
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd, as was lately mention'd, with the Acid Oyl of
  Vitriol; and though common Sulphur yields a White Precipitate, which the
  <i>Chymi&#383;ts</i> call <i>Lac Sulphuris</i>, yet I &#383;uppos'd the
  Precipitated Antimony would be of a deep Yellow Colour, as well, if made
  with Oyl of Vitriol, as if made only by Refrigeration and length of Time.
  From this 'twas ea&#383;ie to deduce this Experiment, that if you put
  into one Gla&#383;s &#383;ome of the fre&#383;hly Impregnated and
  Filtrated Solution of Antimony, and into another &#383;ome of the
  Orange-Colour'd Mixture, (which I formerly &#383;hew'd you how to make
  with a <!-- Page 313 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313"></a>[pg
  313]</span> Mercurial Solution and Oyl of Tartar) a few drops of Oyl of
  Vitriol dropp'd into the la&#383;t mention'd Gla&#383;s, would, as I told
  you before, turn the Deep Yellow mixture into a Cleer Liquor; whereas a
  little of the &#383;ame Oyl dropp'd out of the &#383;ame Viol into the
  other Gla&#383;s would pre&#383;ently (but not without &#383;ome ill
  &#383;ent) turn the moderately cleer Solution into a Deep Yellow
  Sub&#383;tance, But this, as I Said, &#383;ucceeds not well, unle&#383;s
  you employ a <i>Lixivium</i> that has but newly di&#383;&#383;olv'd
  Antimony, and has not yet let it fall. But yet in Summer time, if your
  <i>Lixivium</i> have been duly Impregnated and well Filtred after it is
  quite cold, it will for &#383;ome dayes (perhaps much longer than I had
  occa&#383;ion to try) retain Antimony enough to exhibit, upon the
  Affu&#383;ion of the Corro&#383;ive Oyl, as much of a good Yellow
  Sub&#383;tance as is nece&#383;&#383;ary to &#383;atisfie the Beholders
  of the Po&#383;&#383;ibility of the Experiment.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Reflections upon the XL. Experiment
Compared with the X. and
XX.</i></p>

  <p>The Knowledge of the Di&#383;tinction of Salts which we have propos'd,
  whereby they are di&#383;criminated into <i>Acid, Volatile,</i> <!-- Page
  314 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314"></a>[pg 314]</span> or
  <i>Salfuginous</i> (if I may for Di&#383;tinction &#383;ake &#383;o call
  the Fugitive Salts of Animal Sub&#383;tances) and <i>fix'd</i> or
  <i>Alcalizate</i>, may po&#383;&#383;ibly (by that little part which we
  have already deliver'd, of what we could &#383;ay of its
  Applicablene&#383;s) appear of &#383;o much U&#383;e in Natural
  Philo&#383;ophy (e&#383;pecially in the Practick part of it) that I doubt
  not but it will be no Unwelcome Corollary of the Preceding Experiment, if
  by the help of it I teach you to di&#383;tingui&#383;h, which of
  tho&#383;e Salts is Predominant in Chymical Liquors, as well as whether
  any of them be &#383;o or not. For though in our Notes upon the X. and
  XX. Experiments I have &#383;hown you a way by means of the Tincture of
  <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>, or of Syrrup of Violets, to di&#383;cover
  whether a propounded Salt be Acid or not, yet you can thereby only find
  in general that &#383;uch and &#383;uch Salts belong not to the Tribe of
  Acids, but cannot determine whether they belong to the Tribe of Urinous
  Salts (under which for di&#383;tinction &#383;ake I comprehend all
  tho&#383;e Volatile Salts of Animal or other Sub&#383;tances that are
  contrary to Acids) or to that of Alcalies. For as well the one as the
  other of the&#383;e Salino-Sulphurous Salts will re&#383;tore the
  Cæruleous Colour to the Tincture of <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>, and turn
  that of Syrrup of Violets <!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_315"></a>[pg 315]</span> into Green. Wherefore this XL.
  Experiment does opportunely &#383;upply the deficiency of tho&#383;e. For
  being &#383;ollicitous to find out &#383;ome ready wayes of
  di&#383;criminating the Tribes of Chymical Salts, I found that all
  tho&#383;e I thought fit to make Tryal of, would, if they were of a
  Lixiviate Nature, make with Sublimate di&#383;&#383;olv'd in Fair Water
  an <i>Orange Tawny</i> Precipitate; whereas if they were of an Urinous
  Nature the Precipitate would be <i>White</i> and Milky. So that having
  alwayes by me &#383;ome Syrrup of Violets and &#383;ome Solution of
  Sublimate, I can by the help of the fir&#383;t of tho&#383;e Liquors
  di&#383;cover in a trice, whether the propounded Salt or Saline Body be
  of an Acid Nature or no, if it be I need (you know) inquire no further;
  but if it be not, I can very ea&#383;ily, and as readily
  di&#383;tingui&#383;h between the other two kinds of Salts, by the White
  or Orange-Colour that is immediately produc'd, by letting fall a few
  Drops or Grains of the Salt to be examin'd, into a &#383;poonfull of the
  cleer Solution of Sublimate. For Example, it has been &#383;uppos'd by
  &#383;ome eminently Learned, That when Sal Armoniack being mingled with
  an Alcaly is forc'd from it by the Fire in clo&#383;e Ve&#383;&#383;els,
  the Volatile Salt that will thereby be obtain'd (if the Operation be
  skilfully perform'd,) <!-- Page 316 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_316"></a>[pg 316]</span> is but a more fine and &#383;ubtile
  &#383;ort of Sal Armoniack, which, 'tis pre&#383;um'd, this Operation
  do's but more exqui&#383;itely purifie, than common Solutions,
  Filtrations, and Coagulations. But this Opinion may be ea&#383;ily
  &#383;hown to be Erroneous, as by other Arguments, &#383;o particularly
  by the lately deliver'd Method of di&#383;tingui&#383;hing the Tribes of
  Salts. For the Saline Spirit of Sal Armoniack, as it is in many other
  manife&#383;t Qualities very like the Spirit of Urine, &#383;o like, that
  it will in a trice make Syrrup of Violets of a Lovely Green, turn a
  Solution of good Verdigrea&#383;e into an Excellent Azure, and make the
  Solution of a Sublimate yield a White Precipitate, in&#383;omuch that in
  mo&#383;t (for I &#383;ay not all of the Experiments) where I Aim onely
  at producing a &#383;udden change of Colour, I &#383;cruple not to
  u&#383;e Spirit of Sal Armoniack when it is at hand, in&#383;tead of
  Spirit of Urine, as indeed it &#383;eems chiefly to con&#383;i&#383;t
  (be&#383;ides the flegm that helps to make it fluid) of the Volatile
  Urinous Salt (yet not excluding that of Soot) that abounds in the Sal
  Armoniack and is &#383;et at liberty from the Sea Salt wherewith it was
  formerly a&#383;&#383;ociated, and clogg'd, by the Operation of the
  Alcaly, that divides the Ingredients of Sal Armoniack, and retains that
  Sea Salt with it &#383;elf. What u&#383;e may be <!-- Page 317 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317"></a>[pg 317]</span> made of the like
  way of exploration in that inquiry which puzzles &#383;o many Modern
  Naturali&#383;ts, whether the Rich Pigment (which we have often had
  occa&#383;ion to mention) belongs to the Vegetable or Animal Kingdome,
  you may find in another place where I give you &#383;ome account of what
  I try'd about Cocheneel. But I think it needle&#383;s to exemplifie here
  our Method by any other In&#383;tances, many &#383;uch being to be met
  with in divers parts of this Treati&#383;e; but I will rather
  adverti&#383;e you, that, by this way of examining Chymical Liquors, you
  may not onely in mo&#383;t Ca&#383;es conclude <i>Affirmatively</i>, but
  in &#383;ome Ca&#383;es <i>Negatively</i>. As &#383;ince Spirit of Wine,
  and as far as I have try'd, tho&#383;e Chymical Oyles which Arti&#383;ts
  call E&#383;&#383;ential, did not (when I us'd them as I had us'd the
  &#383;everal Families of Salts upon that Syrrup) turn Syrrup of Violets
  Red or Green, nor the Solution of Sublimate White or Yellow, I inferr'd
  it may thence be probably argued, that either they are de&#383;titute of
  Salt, or have &#383;uch as belongs not to either of the three Grand
  families already often mention'd. When I went to examine the Spirit of
  Oak or of &#383;uch like Concretes forced over through a Retort, I found
  by this means among&#383;t others, that (as I el&#383;ewhere &#383;how)
  the&#383;e Chymi&#383;ts are <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_318"></a>[pg 318]</span> much mi&#383;taken in it, that
  account it a &#383;imple Liquor, and one of their Hypo&#383;tatical
  Principles: for not to mention what flegm it may have, I found that with
  a few drops of one of this &#383;ort of Spirits mix'd with a good
  proportion of Syrrup of Violets, I could change the Colour and make it
  Purpli&#383;h, by the affinity of which Colour to Redne&#383;s, I
  conjectur'd that this Spirit had &#383;ome Acid Corpu&#383;cles in it,
  and accordingly I found that as it would de&#383;troy the Blewne&#383;s
  of a Tincture of <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>, &#383;o being put upon Corals
  it would Corrode them, as common Spirit of Vinegar, and other Acid
  Liquors are wont to do. And farther to examine whether there were not a
  great part of the Liquor that was not of an Acid nature, having
  &#383;eparated the Sour or Vinegar-like part from the re&#383;t, which
  (if I mi&#383;take not) is far the more Copious, we concluded as we had
  conjectured, the other or remaining part, though it had a &#383;trong
  ta&#383;te as well as &#383;mell, to be of a nature differing from that
  of either of the three &#383;orts of Salts above mention'd, &#383;ince it
  did as little as Spirit of Wine, and Chymical Oyls, alter the Colour
  either of Syrrup of Violets or Solution of Sublimate, whence we al&#383;o
  inferr'd that the change that had been made of that Syrrup into a Purple
  Colour, was <!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_319"></a>[pg 319]</span> effected by the Vinegar, that was one
  of the two Ingredients of the Liquor, which was wont to pa&#383;s for a
  Simple or Uncompounded Spirit. And, upon this account, 'twas of the
  Spirit of Oak (and the like Concretes) freed from it's Vinegar that I
  el&#383;ewhere told you, that I had not then ob&#383;erv'd it, (and I
  have repeated the Tryal but very lately) to de&#383;troy the Cæruleous
  Tincture of <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>. But this onely, <i>en
  pa&#383;sant</i>; for the Chief thing I had to add was this, That by the
  &#383;ame way may be examin'd and di&#383;cover'd, divers changes that
  are produc'd in Bodies either by Nature only, or by Art; either of them
  being able by changing the Texture of &#383;ome Concretes I could name,
  to qualifie them to Operate after a New manner upon the above mention'd
  Syrrup, or Solution, or both. And by this means, to tell you that upon
  the by, I have been able to di&#383;cover, that there may be made Bodies,
  which though they run <i>per Deliquium</i>, as readily as Salt of Tartar,
  belong in other re&#383;pects, not to the family of Alcaliz, much
  le&#383;s to that of Salfuginous, or that of Acid Salts. Perhaps too, I
  may know a way of making a highly operative Saline Body that &#383;hall
  neither change the Colour of Syrrup of Violets, nor Precipitate the
  Solution of Sublimate; And, I can <!-- Page 320 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320"></a>[pg 320]</span> likewi&#383;e if I
  plea&#383;e conceal by what Liquors I perform &#383;uch changes of
  Colour, as I have been mentioning to you, by quite altering the Texture
  of &#383;ome ordinary Chymical productions, the Exploration of which is
  the main u&#383;e of the fortieth Experiment, which I think teaches not a
  little, if it teach us to di&#383;cover the nature of tho&#383;e things
  (in reference to Salt) that are obtain'd by the ordinary Chymical
  Analy&#383;is of mix'd Bodyes, though perhaps there may be other Bodyes
  prepar'd by Chymi&#383;try which may have the &#383;ame Effects in the
  change of Colours; and yet be produc'd not from what Chymi&#383;ts call
  the Re&#383;olution of Bodies, but from their Compo&#383;ition. But the
  di&#383;cour&#383;ing of things of this nature is more proper for another
  place. I &#383;hall now onely add, what might perhaps have been more
  &#383;ea&#383;onably told you before; That the Rea&#383;on why the way of
  Exploration of Salts hitherto deliver'd, &#383;ucceeds in the Solution of
  Sublimate, depends upon the particular Texture of that Solution, as well
  as upon the differing Natures of the Saline Liquors imploy'd to
  Precipitate it. For Gold di&#383;&#383;olv'd in <i>Aqua Regia</i>,
  whether you Precipitate it with Oyl of Tartar which is an Alcaly, or with
  Spirit of Urine <!-- Erratum: for Urne -->, or Sal Armoniack which
  belongs to the family of <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_321"></a>[pg 321]</span> Volatile Salts, will either way
  afford a Yellow &#383;ub&#383;tance: though with &#383;uch an Acid
  Liquor, as, I &#383;ay not Spirit of Salt, the Body that yields it, being
  upon the matter an Ingredient of <i>Aqua Regis</i>, but Oyl of Vitriol it
  &#383;elf, I did not find that I could Precipitate the Metall out of the
  Solution, or de&#383;troy the Colour of it, though the &#383;ame Oyl of
  Vitriol would readily Precipitate Silver di&#383;&#383;olv'd in
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i>. And if you di&#383;&#383;olve pure Silver in
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, and &#383;uffer it to &#383;hoot into Cry&#383;tals,
  the cleer Solution of the&#383;e made in fair Water, will afford a very
  White Precipitate, whether it be made with an Alcaly, or an Acid Spirit,
  as that of Salt, whereas, which may &#383;eem &#383;omewhat &#383;trange,
  with Spirit of Sal Armoniack (that I us'd was made of Quicklime) I could
  obtain no &#383;uch White Precipitate; that Volatile Spirit, nor (as I
  remember) that of Urine, &#383;carce doing any more than &#383;triking
  down a very &#383;mall quantity of Matter, which was neither White nor
  Whiti&#383;h, &#383;o that the remaining Liquor being &#383;uffer'd to
  evaporate till the &#383;uperfluous Moi&#383;ture was gone, the
  greate&#383;t part of the Metalline Corpu&#383;cles with the Saline ones
  that had imbib'd them, concoagulated into Salt, as is u&#383;ual in
  &#383;uch Solutions, wherein the Metall has not been Precipitated.</p>

<!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322"></a>[pg 322]</span>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XLI.</i></h3>

  <p>Of Kin to the la&#383;t or fortieth Experiment is another which I
  remember I have &#383;ometimes &#383;hewn to <i>Virtuo&#383;i</i> that
  were pleas'd not to di&#383;like it. I took Spirit of Urine made by
  Fermentation, and with a due proportion of Copper brought into &#383;mall
  parts, I obtain'd a very lovely Azure Solution, and when I &#383;aw the
  Colour was &#383;uch as was requi&#383;ite, pouring into a clean
  Gla&#383;s, about a &#383;poonfull of this tincted Liquor, (of which I
  us'd to keep a Quantity by me,) I could by &#383;haking into it &#383;ome
  drops of Strong Oyl of Vitriol, deprive it in a trice of its Deep Colour,
  and make it look like Common-water.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation</i>.</p>

  <p>This Experiment brings into my mind this other, which oftentimes
  &#383;uccceds well enough, though not quite &#383;o well as the former;
  Namely, that if into about a &#383;mall &#383;poonfull of a Solution of
  good French Verdigrea&#383;e made in fair Water, I drop't and &#383;hak'd
  &#383;ome &#383;trong Spirit of Salt, or rather deflegm'd <i>Aqua
  Fortis</i>, the Greenne&#383;s of the Solution would be made in a trice
  almo&#383;t <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_323"></a>[pg 323]</span> totally to di&#383;appear, &amp; the
  Liquor held again&#383;t the Light would &#383;carce &#383;eeme other
  than Cleer or Limpid, to any but an Attentive Eye, which is therefore
  remarkable; becau&#383;e we know that <i>Aqua-fortis</i> corroding
  Copper, which is it that gives the Colour to Verdigrea&#383;e, is wont to
  reduce it to a Green Blew Solution. But if into the other altogether or
  almo&#383;t Colourle&#383;s Liquor I was &#383;peaking of, you drop a
  ju&#383;t quantity either of Oyl of Tartar or Spirit of Urine, you
  &#383;hall find that after the Ebullition is ceas'd, the mixture will
  di&#383;clo&#383;e a lively Colour, though &#383;omewhat differing from
  that which the Solution of Verdigrea&#383;e had at fir&#383;t.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XLII.</i></h3>

  <p>That the Colour (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) of a Body may be chang'd by a
  Liquor which of it &#383;elf is of no Colour, provided it be Saline, we
  have already manife&#383;ted by a multitude of in&#383;tances. Nor doth
  it &#383;eem &#383;o &#383;trange, becau&#383;e Saline Particles
  &#383;wimming up and down in Liquors, have been by many ob&#383;erv'd to
  be very operative in the Production and change of Colours. But divers of
  our Friends that are not acquainted with Chymical Operations have thought
  it very &#383;trange that a White Body, and a Dry one <!-- Page 324
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324"></a>[pg 324]</span> too,
  &#383;hould immediately acquire a rich new Colour upon the bare
  affu&#383;ion of Spring-Water de&#383;titute as well of adventitious Salt
  as of Tincture. And yet (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) the way of producing
  &#383;uch a change of Colours may be ea&#383;ily enough lighted on by
  tho&#383;e that are conver&#383;ant in the Solutions of Mercury. For we
  have try'd, that though by Evaporating a Solution of Quick-Silver in
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, and ab&#383;tracting the Liquor till the remaining
  matter began to be well, but not too &#383;trongly dryed, fair Water
  pour'd on the remaining <i>Calx</i> made it but &#383;omewhat
  Yellowi&#383;h; yet when we took good Quick-Silver, and three or four
  times its weight of Oyl of Vitriol, in ca&#383;e we in a Gla&#383;s
  Retort plac'd in Sand drew off the Saline <i>Men&#383;truum</i> from the
  Metalline Liquor, till there remain'd a dry <i>Calx</i> at the bottome,
  though this Precipitate were a Snow White Body, yet upon pouring on it a
  large quantity of fair Water, we did almo&#383;t in a moment perceive it
  to pa&#383;s from a Milky Colour to one of the lovelie&#383;t Light
  Yellows that ever we had beheld. Nor is the Turbith Mineral, that
  Chymi&#383;ts extol for its power to Salivate, and for other vertues, of
  a Colour much inferiour to this, though it be often made with a differing
  proportion of the Ingredients, <!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_325"></a>[pg 325]</span> a more trouble&#383;ome way. For
  <i>Beguinus</i>,<a name="NtA_22"></a><a href="#Nt_22"><sup>22</sup></a>
  who calls it <i>Mercurius præcipitatus optimus</i>, takes to one part of
  Quick-Silver, but two of Liquor, and that is Rectifi'd Oyl of Sulphur,
  which is (in <i>England</i> at lea&#383;t) far more &#383;carce and dear
  than Oyl of Vitriol; he al&#383;o requires a previous Dige&#383;tion, two
  or three Cohobations, and frequent Ablutions with hot Di&#383;till'd
  Water, with other pre&#383;criptions, which though they may conduce to
  the Goodne&#383;s of the Medicine, which is that he aims at, are
  trouble&#383;ome, and, our Tryals have inform'd you
  unnecce&#383;&#383;ary to the <i>obtaining the Lemmon Colour</i> which he
  regards not. But though we have very rarely &#383;een either in Painters
  Shops, or el&#383;ewhere a finer Yellow than that which we have divers
  times this way produc'd (which is the more con&#383;iderable,
  becau&#383;e durable and plea&#383;ant Yellows are very hard to be met
  with, as may appear by the great u&#383;e which Painters are for its
  Colours &#383;ake fain to make of that pernicious and heavy Mineral,
  Orpiment) yet I fear our Yellow is too co&#383;tly, to be like to be
  imploy'd by Painters, unle&#383;s about Choice pieces of Work, nor do I
  know how well it will agree with every Pigment, e&#383;pecially, wich
  Oyl'd Colours. And whether this <!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_326"></a>[pg 326]</span> Experiment, though it have
  &#383;eem'd &#383;omewhat &#383;trange to mo&#383;t we have &#383;hown it
  to, be really of another Nature than tho&#383;e wherein Saline Liquors
  are imploy'd, may, as we formerly al&#383;o hinted, be &#383;o
  plau&#383;ibly doubted, that whether the Water pour'd on the <i>Calx</i>,
  do barely by imbibing &#383;ome of its Saline parts alter its Colour by
  altering its Texture, or whether by di&#383;&#383;olving the
  Concoagulated Salts, it does become a Saline <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, and,
  as &#383;uch, work upon the Mercury, I freely leave to you
  (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) to con&#383;ider. And that I may give you &#383;ome
  A&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance in your Enquiry, I will not only tell you, that
  I have &#383;everal times with fair Water wa&#383;h'd from this
  <i>Calx</i>, good &#383;tore of &#383;trongly ta&#383;ted
  Corpu&#383;cles, which by the ab&#383;traction of the
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, I could reduce into Salt; but I will al&#383;o
  &#383;ubjoyn an Experiment, which I devis'd, to &#383;hew among other
  things, how much a real and permanent Colour may be as it were drawn
  forth by a Liquor that has neither Colour, nor &#383;o much as Saline or
  other Active parts, provided it can but bring the parts of the Body it
  imbibes to convene into clu&#383;ters di&#383;pos'd after the manner
  requi&#383;ite to the exhibiting of the emergent Colour. The Experiment
  was this.</p>

<!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327"></a>[pg 327]</span>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XLIII.</i></h3>

  <p>We took good common Vitriol, and having beaten it to Powder, and put
  it into a Crucible, we kept it melted in a gentle heat, till by the
  Evaporation of &#383;ome parts, and the &#383;huffling of the re&#383;t,
  it had quite lo&#383;t its former Colour, what remain'd we took out, and
  found it to be a friable <i>Calx</i>, of a dirty Gray. On this we pour'd
  fair Water, which it did not Colour Green or Blew, but only &#383;eem'd
  to make a muddy mixture with it, then &#383;topping the Vial wherein the
  Ingredients were put, we let it &#383;tand in a quiet place for &#383;ome
  dayes, and after many hours the water having di&#383;&#383;olv'd a good
  part of the imperfectly calcin'd Body, the Vitriolate Corpu&#383;cles
  &#383;wiming to and fro in the Liquor, had time by their opportune
  Occur&#383;ions to con&#383;titute many little Ma&#383;&#383;es of
  Vitriol, which gave the water they impregnated a fair Vitriolate Colour;
  and this Liquor being pour'd off, the remaining dirty Powder did in
  proce&#383;s of time communicate the like Colour, but not &#383;o deep,
  to a &#383;econd parcel of cleer Water that we pour'd on it. But this
  Experiment <i>Pyrophilus</i> is, (to give you that hint by the way) of
  too Luciferous a Nature to be fit to be <!-- Page 328 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328"></a>[pg 328]</span> fully
  pro&#383;ecuted, now that I am in ha&#383;te, and willing to
  di&#383;patch what remains. And we have already &#383;aid of it, as much
  as is requi&#383;ite to our pre&#383;ent purpo&#383;e.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XLIV.</i></h3>

  <p>It may (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) &#383;omewhat contribute towards the
  &#383;hewing how much &#383;ome Colours depend upon the le&#383;s or
  greater mixture, and (as it were,) Contemperation of the Light with
  &#383;hades, to ob&#383;erve, how that &#383;ometimes the number of
  Particles, of the &#383;ame Colour, receiv'd into the Pores of a Liquor,
  or &#383;wiming up and down in it, do &#383;eem much to vary the Colour
  of it. I could here pre&#383;ent you with particular in&#383;tances to
  &#383;how, how in many (if not mo&#383;t) con&#383;i&#383;tent Bodyes, if
  the Colour be not a Light one, as White, Yellow, or the like, the
  clo&#383;ene&#383;s of parts in the Pigments makes it look Blacki&#383;h,
  though when it is di&#383;play'd and laid on thinly, it will perhaps
  appear to be either Blew, or Green, or Red. But the Colours of
  con&#383;i&#383;tent Pigments, not being tho&#383;e which the Preamble of
  this Experiment has lead you to expect Examples in, I &#383;hall take the
  in&#383;tances I am now to give you, rather from Liquors than Dry Bodyes.
  If then you put a little fair Water into a <!-- Page 329 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329"></a>[pg 329]</span> cleer and
  &#383;lender Vial, (or rather into one of tho&#383;e pipes of Gla&#383;s,
  which we &#383;hall by and by mention;) and let fall into it a few drops
  of a &#383;trong Decoction or Infu&#383;ion of <i>Cochineel</i>, or (for
  want of that) of <i>Brazil</i>; you may &#383;ee the tincted drops
  de&#383;cend like little Clouds into the Liquor; through which, if, by
  &#383;haking the Vial, you diffu&#383;e them, they will turn the water
  either of a Pinck Colour, or like that which is wont to be made by the
  wa&#383;hing of raw fle&#383;h in fair Water; by dropping a little more
  of the Decoction, you may heighten the Colour into a fine Red,
  almo&#383;t like that which ennobles Rubies; by continuing the
  affu&#383;ion, you may bring the Liquor to a kind of a Crim&#383;on, and
  afterwards to a Dark and Opacous Redne&#383;s, &#383;omewhat like that of
  Clotted Blood. And in the pa&#383;&#383;age of the Liquor from one of
  the&#383;e Colours to the other, you may ob&#383;erve, if you
  con&#383;ider it attentively, divers other le&#383;s noted Colours
  belonging to Red, to which it is not ea&#383;ie to give Names;
  e&#383;pecially con&#383;idering how much the proportion of the Decoction
  to the fair Water, and the &#383;trength of that Decoction, together with
  that of the trajected Light and other Circum&#383;tances, may vary the
  Phænomena of this Experiment. For the convenienter making whereof, we
  u&#383;e <!-- Page 330 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_330"></a>[pg 330]</span> in&#383;tead of a Vial, any
  &#383;lender Pipe of Gla&#383;s of about a foot or more in length, and
  about the thickne&#383;s of a mans little finger; For, if leaving one end
  of this Pipe open, you Seal up the other Hermetically, (or at lea&#383;t
  &#383;top it exqui&#383;itely with a Cork well fitted to it, and
  over-laid with hard Sealing Wax melted, and rubb'd upon it;) you
  &#383;hall have a Gla&#383;s, wherein may be ob&#383;erv'd the Variations
  of the Colours of Liquors much better than in large Vials, and wherein
  Experiments of this Nature may be well made with very &#383;mall
  quantities of Liquor. And if you plea&#383;e, you may in this Pipe
  produce variety of Colours in the various parts of the Liquor, and keep
  them &#383;wimming upon one another unmix'd for a good while. And
  &#383;ome have marveil'd to &#383;ee, what variety of Colours we have
  &#383;ometimes (but I confe&#383;s rather by chance than skill) produc'd
  in tho&#383;e Gla&#383;&#383;es, by the bare infu&#383;ion of Brazil,
  variou&#383;ly diluted with fair Water, and alter'd by the Infu&#383;ion
  of &#383;everal Chymical Spirits and other Saline Liquors devoid
  them&#383;elves of Colour, and when the whole Liquor is reduc'd to an
  Uniform degree of Colour, I have taken plea&#383;ure to make that very
  Liquor &#383;eem to be of Colours gradually differing, by filling with it
  Gla&#383;&#383;es of a Conical figure, (whether the Gla&#383;s have <!--
  Page 331 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331"></a>[pg 331]</span>
  its ba&#383;is in the ordinary po&#383;ition, or turn'd upwards.) And yet
  you need not Gla&#383;&#383;es of an extraordinary &#383;hape to &#383;ee
  an in&#383;tance of what the vari'd mixture of Light and Shadow can do in
  the diver&#383;ifying of the Colour. For if you take but a large round
  Vial, with a &#383;omewhat long and &#383;lender Neck, and filling it
  with our Red Infu&#383;ion of Brazil, hold it again&#383;t the Light, you
  will di&#383;cern a notable Di&#383;parity betwixt the Colour of that
  part of the Liquor which is in the Body of the Vial, and that which is
  more pervious to the Light in the Neck. Nay, I remember, that I once had
  a Gla&#383;s and a Blew Liquor (con&#383;i&#383;ting chiefly (or only, if
  my memory deceive me not,) of a certain Solution of Verdigrea&#383;e)
  &#383;o fitted for my purpo&#383;e, that though in other
  Gla&#383;&#383;es the Experiment would not &#383;ucceed, yet when that
  particular Gla&#383;s was fill'd with that Solution, in the Body of the
  Vial it appear'd of a Lovely Blew, and in the neck, (where the Light did
  more dilute the Colour,) of a manife&#383;t Green; and though I
  &#383;u&#383;pected there might be &#383;ome latent Yellowne&#383;s in
  the &#383;ub&#383;tance of the neck of the Gla&#383;s, which might with
  the Blew compo&#383;e that Green, yet was I not &#383;atisfi'd my
  &#383;elf with my Conjecture, but the thing &#383;eem'd odd to me, as
  well as to divers curious <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_332"></a>[pg 332]</span> per&#383;ons to whom it was
  &#383;hown. And I lately had a Broad piece of Gla&#383;s, which being
  look'd on again&#383;t the Light &#383;eem'd clear enough, and held from
  the Light appear'd very lightly di&#383;colour'd, and yet it was a piece
  knock'd off from a great lump of Gla&#383;s, to which if we rejoyn'd it,
  where it had been broken off, the whole Ma&#383;s was as green as
  Gra&#383;s. And I have &#383;everal times us'd Bottles and &#383;topples
  that were both made (as tho&#383;e, I had them from a&#383;&#383;ur'd me)
  of the very &#383;ame Metall, and yet whil&#383;t the bottle appear'd but
  inclining towards a Green, the Stopple (by rea&#383;on of its great
  thickne&#383;s) was of &#383;o deep a Colour that you would hardly
  believe they could po&#383;&#383;ibly be made of the &#383;ame materials.
  But to &#383;atisfie &#383;ome Ingenious Men, on another occa&#383;ion, I
  provided my &#383;elf of a flat Gla&#383;s (which I yet have by me,) with
  which if I look again&#383;t the Light with the Broad &#383;ide obverted
  to the Eye, it appeares like a good ordinary window Gla&#383;s; but if I
  turn the Edge of it to my Eye, and place my Eye in a convenient
  po&#383;ture in reference to the Light, it may contend for deepne&#383;s
  of Colour with an Emerald. And this Greene&#383;s puts me in mind of a
  certain thicki&#383;h, but not con&#383;i&#383;tent Pigment I have
  &#383;ometimes made, and can &#383;how you when you plea&#383;e, <!--
  Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333"></a>[pg 333]</span>
  which being dropp'd on a piece of White Paper appears, where any quantity
  of it is fallen, of a &#383;omewhat Crim&#383;on Colour, but being with
  ones finger &#383;pread thinly on the Paper does pre&#383;ently exhibit a
  fair Green, which &#383;eems to proceed only from its
  di&#383;clo&#383;ing its Colour upon the Extenuation of its Depth into
  Superficies, if the change be not &#383;omewhat help'd by the Colours
  degenerating upon one or other of the Accounts formerly mention'd. Let me
  add, that having made divers Tryals with that Blew &#383;ub&#383;tance,
  which in Painters &#383;hops is call'd <i>Litma&#383;e</i>, we have
  &#383;ometimes taken Plea&#383;ure to ob&#383;erve, that being
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd in a due proportion of fair Water, the Solution
  either oppos'd to the Light, or dropp'd upon White paper, did appear of a
  deep Colour betwixt Crim&#383;on and Purple; and yet that being
  &#383;pread very thin on the Paper and &#383;uffer'd to dry on there, the
  Paper was wont to appear Stain'd of a Fine Blew. And to &#383;atisfie my
  &#383;elfe, that the diver&#383;ity came not from the Paper, which one
  might &#383;u&#383;pect capable of inbibing the Liquor, and altering the
  Colour, I made the Tryal upon a flat piece of purely White Gla&#383;s'd
  Earth, (which I &#383;ometimes make u&#383;e of about Experiments of
  Colours) with an Event not unlike the former.</p>

<!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334"></a>[pg 334]</span>

  <p>And now I &#383;peak of <i>Litma&#383;s</i>, I will add, that having
  this very day taken a piece of it, that I had kept by me the&#383;e
  &#383;everal years, to make Tryals about Colours, and having let fall a
  few drops of the &#383;trong Infu&#383;ion of it in fair water, into a
  fine Cry&#383;tal Gla&#383;s, &#383;hap'd like an inverted Cone, and
  almo&#383;t full of fair Water, I had now (as formerly) the plea&#383;ure
  to &#383;ee, and to &#383;how others, how the&#383;e few tincted drops
  variou&#383;ly di&#383;per&#383;ing them&#383;elves through the Limpid
  Water, exhibited divers Colours, or varieties of Purple and Crim&#383;on.
  And when the Corpu&#383;cles of the Pigment &#383;eem'd to have equally
  diffus'd them&#383;elves through the whole Liquor, I then by putting two
  or three drops of Spirit of Salt, fir&#383;t made an odd change in the
  Colour of the Liquor, as well as a vi&#383;ible commotion among its
  &#383;mall parts, and in a &#383;hort time chang'd it wholly into a very
  Glorious Yellow, like that of a Topaz. After which if I let fall a few
  drops of the &#383;trong and heavy Solution of Pot-a&#383;hes, who&#383;e
  weight would quickly carry it to the &#383;harp bottome of the
  Gla&#383;s, there would &#383;oon appear four very plea&#383;ant and
  di&#383;tinct Colours; Namely, a Bright, but Dilute Colour at the picked
  bottome of the Gla&#383;s; a Purple, a little higher; a deep and glorious
  Crim&#383;on, (which Crim&#383;on <!-- Page 335 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335"></a>[pg 335]</span> &#383;eem'd to
  terminate the operation of the Salt upward) in the confines betwixt the
  Purple and the Yellow; and an Excellent Yellow, the &#383;ame that before
  enobled the whole Liquor, reaching from thence to the top of the
  Gla&#383;s. And if I pleas'd to pour very gently a little Spirit of Sal
  Armoniack, upon the upper part of this Yellow, there would al&#383;o be a
  Purple or a Crim&#383;on, or both, generated there, &#383;o that the
  unalter'd part of the Yellow Liquor appear'd intercepted betwixt the two
  Neighbouring Colours.</p>

  <p>My &#383;cope in this 3<sup>d</sup>. Experiment (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) is
  manifold, as fir&#383;t to invite you to be wary in judging of the Colour
  of Liquors in &#383;uch Gla&#383;&#383;es as are therein recommended to
  you, and con&#383;equently as much, if not more, when you imploy other
  Gla&#383;&#383;es. Secondly, That you may not think it &#383;trange, that
  I often content my &#383;elf to rub upon a piece of White paper, the
  Juice of Bodies I would examine, &#383;ince not onely I could not
  ea&#383;ily procure a &#383;ufficient Quantity of the juices of divers of
  them; but in &#383;everal Ca&#383;es the Tryals of the quantities of
  &#383;uch Juices in Gla&#383;&#383;es would make us more lyable to
  mi&#383;takes, than the way that in tho&#383;e ca&#383;es I have made
  u&#383;e of. Thirdly, I hope you will by the&#383;e and divers other <!--
  Page 336 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336"></a>[pg 336]</span>
  particulars deliver'd in this Treati&#383;e, be ea&#383;ily induc'd to
  think that I may have &#383;et down many Phænomena very faithfully, and
  ju&#383;t as they appear'd to me, and yet by rea&#383;on of &#383;ome
  unheeded circum&#383;tance in the conditions of the matter, and in the
  degree of Light, or the manner of trying the Experiment, you may find
  &#383;ome things to vary from the Relations I make of them. La&#383;tly,
  I de&#383;ign'd to give you an opportunity to free your &#383;elf from
  the amazement which po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;es mo&#383;t Men, at the
  Tricks of tho&#383;e Mountebancks that are commonly call'd
  Water-drinkers. For though not only the vulgar, but ev'n many
  per&#383;ons that are far above that Rank, have &#383;o much admir'd to
  &#383;ee, a man after having drunk a great deal of fair water, to
  &#383;purt it out again in the form of Claret Wine, Sack, and Milk, that
  they have &#383;u&#383;pected the intervening of Magick, or &#383;ome
  forbidden means to effect what they conceived above the power of Art; yet
  having once by chance had occa&#383;ion to oblige a Wanderer that made
  profe&#383;&#383;ion of that and other Jugling Tricks, I was ea&#383;ily
  confirm'd by his Ingenious confe&#383;&#383;ion to me, That this &#383;o
  much Admir'd Art, indeed con&#383;i&#383;ted rather in a few Tricks, than
  in any great Skill, in altering the Nature and Colours of things. And I
  am ea&#383;y <!-- Page 337 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_337"></a>[pg 337]</span> to be per&#383;waded; that there may
  be a great deal of Truth in a little Pamphlet Printed divers years ago in
  Engli&#383;h, wherein the Author undertakes to di&#383;cover, and that
  (if I mi&#383;take not) by the confe&#383;&#383;ion of &#383;ome of the
  Complices them&#383;elves, That a famous Water-drinker then much Admir'd
  in <i>England</i>, perform'd his pretended Tran&#383;mutations of Liquors
  by the help of two or three incon&#383;iderable preparations and mixtures
  of not unobvious Liquors, and chiefly of an Infu&#383;ion of Brazil
  variou&#383;ly diluted and made Pale or Yellowi&#383;h, (and
  otherwi&#383;e alter'd) with Vinegar, the re&#383;t of their work being
  perform'd by the &#383;hape of the Gla&#383;&#383;es, by Craft and
  Legerdemane. And for my part, that which I marvel at in this
  bu&#383;ine&#383;s, is, the Drinkers being able to take down &#383;o much
  Water, and &#383;pout it out with that violence; though Cu&#383;tome and
  a Vomit &#383;ea&#383;onably taken before hand, may in &#383;ome of them
  much facilitate the work. But as for the changes made in the Liquors,
  they were but few and &#383;light in compari&#383;on of tho&#383;e, that
  the being conver&#383;ant in Chymical Experiments, and dextrous in
  applying them to the Tran&#383;muting of Colours, may ea&#383;ily enough
  enable a man to make, as ev'n what has been newly deliver'd in this, and
  the foregoing Experiment; e&#383;pecially if we add <!-- Page 338
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338"></a>[pg 338]</span> to it the
  things contained in the XX, the XXXIX and the XL. Experiments, may
  perhaps have already per&#383;waded You.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XLV.</i></h3>

  <p>You may I pre&#383;ume (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) have taken notice, that in
  this whole Treati&#383;e, I purpo&#383;ely decline (as far as I well can)
  the mentioning of Elaborate Chymical Experiments, for fear of frighting
  you by their tediou&#383;ne&#383;s and difficulty; but yet in
  confirmation of what I have been newly telling you about the
  po&#383;&#383;ibility of Varying the Colours of Liquors, better than the
  Water-drinkers are wont to do, I &#383;hall add, that <i>Helmont</i>
  u&#383;ed to make a preparation of Steel, which a very Ingenious
  Chymi&#383;t, his Sons Friend, whom you know, &#383;ometimes employes for
  a &#383;uccedaneum to the Spaw-waters, by Diluting this <i>E&#383;sentia
  Martis Liquida</i> (as he calls it) with a due proportion of Water. Now
  that for which I mention to you this preparation, (which as he
  communicated to me, I know he will not refu&#383;e to <i>Pyrophilus</i>)
  is this, that though the Liquor (as I can &#383;hew you when you
  plea&#383;e) be almo&#383;t of the Colour of a German (not an Oriental)
  Amethy&#383;t, and con&#383;equently remote enough from Green, <!-- Page
  339 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339"></a>[pg 339]</span> yet a
  very few drops being let fall into a Large proportion of good
  Rheni&#383;h, or (in want of that) White Wine (which yet do's not quite
  &#383;o well) immediately turn'd the Liquor into a lovely Green, as I
  have not without delight &#383;hown &#383;everal curious Per&#383;ons. By
  which <i>Phænomenon</i> you may learn, among other things, how
  requi&#383;ite it is in Experiments about the changes of Colours
  heedfully to mind the Circum&#383;tances of them; for Water will not, as
  I have purpo&#383;ely try'd, concurr to the production of any &#383;uch
  Green, nor did it give that Colour to moderate Spirit of Wine, wherein I
  purpo&#383;ely di&#383;&#383;olv'd it, and Wine it &#383;elf is a Liquor
  that few would &#383;u&#383;pect of being able to work &#383;uddenly any
  &#383;uch change in a Metalline preparation of this Nature; and to
  &#383;atisfie my &#383;elf that this new Colour proceeds rather from the
  peculiar Texture of the Wine, than from any greater Acidity, that
  Rheni&#383;h or White-wine (for that may not ab&#383;urdly be
  &#383;u&#383;pected) has in compari&#383;on of Water; I purpo&#383;ely
  &#383;harpen'd the Solution of this E&#383;&#383;ence in fair Water, with
  a good quantity of Spirit of Salt, notwith&#383;tanding which, the
  mixture acquir'd no Greenne&#383;s. And to vary the Experiment a little,
  I try'd, that if into a Gla&#383;s of Rheni&#383;h Wine made Green by
  this E&#383;&#383;ence, <!-- Page 340 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_340"></a>[pg 340]</span> I dropp'd an Alcalizate Solution, or
  Urinous Spirit, the Wine would pre&#383;ently grow Turbid, and of an odd
  Dirty Colour; But if in&#383;tead of di&#383;&#383;olving the
  E&#383;&#383;ence in Wine, I di&#383;&#383;olv'd it in fair Water
  &#383;harpen'd perhaps with a little Spirit of Salt, then either the
  Urinous Spirit of Sal Armoniack, or the &#383;olution of the fix'd Salt
  of Pot-a&#383;hes would immediately turn it of a Yellowi&#383;h Colour,
  the fix'd or Urinous Salt Precipitating the Vitriolate
  &#383;ub&#383;tance contain'd in the E&#383;&#383;ence. But here I
  mu&#383;t not forget to take notice of a circum&#383;tance that
  de&#383;erves to be compar'd with &#383;ome part of the foregoing
  Experiment, for whereas our E&#383;&#383;ence imparts a Greenne&#383;s to
  Wine, but not to Water, the Indu&#383;trious <i>Olaus Wormius</i><a
  name="NtA_23"></a><a href="#Nt_23"><sup>23</sup></a> in his late
  <i>Musæum</i> tells us of a rare kind of Turn-Sole which he calls
  <i>Bezetta Rubra</i> given him by an Apothecary that knew not how it was
  made, who&#383;e lovely Redne&#383;s would be ea&#383;ily communicated to
  Water, if it were immers'd in it; but &#383;carce to Wine, and not at all
  to Spirit of Wine, in which la&#383;t circum&#383;tance it agrees with
  what I lately told you of our E&#383;&#383;ence, notwith&#383;tanding
  their di&#383;agreement in other particulars.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XLVI.</i></h3>

  <p>We have often taken notice, as of a remarkable thing, that Metalls as
  they appear to the Eye, before they come to be farther alter'd by other
  Bodyes, do exhibit Colours very different from tho&#383;e which the Fire
  and the <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, either apart, or both together, do produce
  in them; e&#383;pecially con&#383;idering that the&#383;e Metalline
  Bodyes are after all the&#383;e di&#383;gui&#383;es reducible not only to
  their former Metalline Con&#383;i&#383;tence and other more radical
  properties, but to their Colour too, as if Nature had given divers
  Metalls to each of them a double Colour, an <i>External</i>, and an
  <i>Internal</i>; But though upon a more attentive Con&#383;ideration of
  this difference of Colours, it &#383;eem'd probable to me, that divers
  (for I &#383;ay not all) of tho&#383;e Colours which we have ju&#383;t
  now call'd <i>Internal</i>, are rather produc'd by the Coalition of
  Metalline Particles with tho&#383;e of the Salts, or other Bodyes
  employ'd to work on them, than by the bare alteration of the parts of the
  Metalls them&#383;elves: and though therefore we may call the obvious
  Colours, Natural or Common, &amp; the others Adventitious, yet
  becau&#383;e &#383;uch changes of Colours, from what&#383;oever
  cau&#383;e they be re&#383;olv'd to <!-- Page 342 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342"></a>[pg 342]</span> proceed may be
  properly enough taken in to illu&#383;trate our pre&#383;ent Subject, we
  &#383;hall not &#383;cruple to take notice of &#383;ome of them,
  e&#383;pecially becau&#383;e there are among them &#383;uch as are
  produc'd without the intervention of Saline <i>Men&#383;truums</i>. Of
  the Adventitious Colours of Metalline Bodies the Chief &#383;orts
  &#383;eem to be the&#383;e three. The fir&#383;t, &#383;uch Colours as
  are produc'd without other Additaments by the Action of the fire upon
  Metalls. The next &#383;uch as emerge from the Coalition of Metalline
  Particles with tho&#383;e of &#383;ome <i>Menstruum</i> imploy'd to
  Corrode a Metall or Precipitate it; And the la&#383;t, The Colours
  afforded by Metalline Bodyes either Colliquated with, or otherwi&#383;e
  Penetrating into, other Bodies, e&#383;pecially fu&#383;ible ones. But
  the&#383;e (<i>Pyrophilus,</i>) are only as I told you, the <i>Chief</i>
  &#383;orts of the adventitious Colours of Metalls, for there may others
  belong to them, of which I &#383;hall hereafter have occa&#383;ion to
  take notice of &#383;ome, and of which al&#383;o there po&#383;&#383;ibly
  may be others that I never took notice of.</p>

  <p>And to begin with the fir&#383;t &#383;ort of Colours, 'tis well
  enough known to Chymi&#383;ts, that Tin being Calcin'd by fire alone is
  wont to afford a White <i>Calx</i>, and Lead Calcin'd by fire alone
  affords that mo&#383;t Common Red-Powder we call <i>Minium:</i> Copper
  al&#383;o <!-- Page 343 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_343"></a>[pg 343]</span> Calcin'd <i>per &#383;e</i>, by a
  long or violent fire, is wont to yield (as far as I have had
  occa&#383;ion to take notice of it) a very Dark or Blacki&#383;h Powder;
  That Iron likewi&#383;e may by the Action of Reverberated flames be
  turn'd into a Colour almo&#383;t like that of Saffron, may be ea&#383;ily
  deduc'd from the Preparation of that Powder, which by rea&#383;on of its
  Colour and of the Metall 'tis made of is by Chymi&#383;ts call'd,
  <i>Crocus Martis per &#383;e</i>. And that <i>Mercury</i> made by the
  &#383;tre&#383;s of Fire, may be turn'd into a Red Powder, which
  Chymi&#383;ts call Precipitate <i>per &#383;e</i>, I el&#383;ewhere more
  particularly declare.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation I.</i></p>

  <p>It is not unworthy the Admoni&#383;hing you, (<i>Pyrophilus</i>,) and
  it agrees very well with our Conjectures about the dependence of the
  change of a Body's Colour upon that of its Texture, that the &#383;ame
  Metall may by the &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ive operation of the fire receive
  divers Adventitious Colours, as is evident in Lead, which before it come
  to &#383;o deep a Colour as that of <i>Minium</i>, may pa&#383;s through
  divers others.</p>

<!-- Page 344 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344"></a>[pg 344]</span>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation II</i>.</p>

  <p>Not only the <i>Calces</i>, but the Gla&#383;&#383;es of Metalls,
  Vitrify'd <i>per &#383;e</i>, may be of Colours differing from the
  Natural or Obvious Colour of the Metall; as I have ob&#383;erv'd in the
  Gla&#383;s of Lead, made by long expo&#383;ing Crude Lead to a violent
  fire, and what I have ob&#383;erv'd about the Gla&#383;s or Slagg of
  Copper, (of which I can &#383;how you &#383;ome of an odd kind of
  Texture,) may be el&#383;ewhere more conveniently related. I have
  likewi&#383;e &#383;een a piece of very Dark Gla&#383;s, which an
  Ingenious Artificer that &#383;how'd it me profe&#383;s'd him&#383;elf to
  have made of Silver alone by an extreme <i>Violence</i> (which &#383;eems
  to be no more than is needfull) of the fire.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation III</i>.</p>

  <p>Minerals al&#383;o by the Action of the Fire may be brought to afford
  Colours very differing from their own, as I not long &#383;ince noted to
  you about the variou&#383;ly Colour'd Flowers of Antimony, to which we
  may add the Whiti&#383;h Grey-Colour of its <i>Calx</i>, and the Yellow
  or Reddi&#383;h Colour of the Gla&#383;s, where into that <i>Calx</i> may
  be flux'd.</p>

  <p>And I remember, that I el&#383;ewhere told <!-- Page 345 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345"></a>[pg 345]</span> you, that Vitriol
  Calcin'd with a very gentle heat, and afterwards with higher and higher
  degrees of it, may be made to pa&#383;s through &#383;everal Colours
  before it de&#383;cends to a Dark Purpli&#383;h Colour, whereto a
  &#383;trong fire is wont at length to reduce it. But to in&#383;i&#383;t
  on the Colours produc'd by the Operation of fire upon &#383;everal
  Minerals would take up farr more time than I have now to &#383;pare.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XLVII.</i></h3>

  <p>The Adventitious Colours produc'd upon Metalls, or rather with them,
  by Saline Liquors, are many of them &#383;o well known to Chymi&#383;ts,
  that I would not here mention them, but that be&#383;ides a not un-needed
  Te&#383;timony, I can add &#383;omething of my own, to what I &#383;hall
  repeat about them, and divers Experiments which are familiar to
  Chymi&#383;ts, are as yet unknown to the greate&#383;t part of Ingenious
  Men.</p>

  <p>That Gold di&#383;&#383;olv'd in <i>Aqua Regia</i> ennobles the
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i> with its own Colour, is a thing that you cannot
  (<i>Pyrophilus</i>,) but have often &#383;een. The Solutions of Mercury
  in <i>Aqua-fortis</i> are not generally taken notice of, to give any
  notable Tincture to the <i>Men&#383;truum</i>; but &#383;ometimes when
  the <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346"></a>[pg
  346]</span> Liquor fir&#383;t falls upon the Quick Silver, I have
  ob&#383;erv'd a very remarkable, though not durable, Greenne&#383;s, or
  Blewne&#383;s to be produc'd, which is a <i>Phænomenon</i> not unfit for
  you to con&#383;ider, though I have not now the lei&#383;ure to
  di&#383;cour&#383;e upon it. Tin Corroded by <i>Aqua-fortis</i> till the
  <i>Menstruum</i> will work no farther on it, becomes exceeding White, but
  as we el&#383;ewhere note, does very ea&#383;ily of it &#383;elf acquire
  the con&#383;i&#383;tence, not of a Metalline <i>Calx</i>, but of a
  Coagulated matter, which we have ob&#383;erv'd with plea&#383;ure to look
  &#383;o like, either to curdled Milk, or curdled Whites of Eggs, that a
  per&#383;on unacquainted with &#383;uch Solutions may ea&#383;ily be
  mi&#383;taken in it. But when I purpo&#383;ely prepar'd a
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i> that would di&#383;&#383;olve it as
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i> di&#383;&#383;olves Silver, and not barely Corrode it,
  and quickly let it fall again, I remember not that I took notice of any
  particular Colour in the Solution, as if the more Whiti&#383;h Metalls
  did not much Tinge their <i>Men&#383;truums</i>, though the
  con&#383;picuou&#383;ly Colour'd Metalls as Gold, and Copper, do. For
  Lead di&#383;&#383;olv'd in Spirit of Vinegar or <i>Aqua-fortis</i> gives
  a Solution cleer enough, and if the <i>Men&#383;truum</i> be
  ab&#383;tracted appears either Diaphanous or White. Of the Colour of Iron
  we have el&#383;ewhere &#383;aid &#383;omething: And 'tis worth <!-- Page
  347 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347"></a>[pg 347]</span>
  noting, that though if that Metall be di&#383;&#383;olv'd in oyl of
  Vitriol diluted with water, it affords a Salt or Magi&#383;tery &#383;o
  like in colour, as well as &#383;ome other Qualities, to other green
  Vitriol, that Chymi&#383;ts do not improperly call it <i>Vitriolum
  Martis</i>; yet I have purpo&#383;ely try'd, that, by changing the
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, and pouring upon the filings of Steel,
  in&#383;tead of oyl of Vitriol, <i>Aqua Fortis</i>, (whereof as I
  remember, I us'd 4 parts to one of the Metall) I obtain'd not a Green,
  but a Saffron Colour Solution; or rather a thick Liquor of a deep but
  yellowi&#383;h Red. Common Silver, &#383;uch as is to be met with in
  Coines, being di&#383;&#383;olv'd in <i>Aqua fortis</i>, yields a
  Solution tincted like that of Copper, which is not to be wondred at,
  becau&#383;e in the coining of Silver, they are wont (as we
  el&#383;ewhere particularly inform you) to give it an Allay of Copper,
  and that which is &#383;old in &#383;hops for refined &#383;ilver, is not
  (&#383;o far as we have tryed) &#383;o perfectly free from that ignobler
  Metall, but that a Solution of It in <i>Aqua fortis</i>, will give a
  Venereal Tincture to the <i>Men&#383;truum</i>. But we could not
  ob&#383;erve upon the &#383;olution of &#383;ome Silver, which was
  perfectly refin'd, (&#383;uch as &#383;ome that we have, from which 8 or
  10 times its weight of Lead has been blown off) that the
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i> <!-- Page 348 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_348"></a>[pg 348]</span> though held again&#383;t the Light in
  a Cry&#383;tal Vial did manife&#383;tly di&#383;clo&#383;e any Tincture,
  only it &#383;eem'd &#383;ometimes not to be quite de&#383;titute of a
  little, but very faint Blewi&#383;hne&#383;s.</p>

  <p>But here I mu&#383;t take notice, that of all the Metalls, there is
  not any which doth &#383;o ea&#383;ily and con&#383;tantly
  di&#383;clo&#383;e its unobvious colour as Copper doth. For not only in
  acid <i>Men&#383;truums</i> as <i>Aqua Fortis</i> and Spirit of Vinegar,
  it gives a Blewi&#383;h green &#383;olution, but if it be almo&#383;t any
  way corroded, it <i>appears of one of tho&#383;e</i> two colours, as may
  be ob&#383;erv'd in Verdigree&#383;e made &#383;everal wayes, in that odd
  preparation of <i>Venus</i>, which we el&#383;ewhere teach you to make
  with Sublimate, and in the common Vitriols of <i>Venus</i> deliver'd by
  Chymi&#383;ts; and &#383;o con&#383;tant is the di&#383;po&#383;ition of
  Copper, notwith&#383;tanding the di&#383;gui&#383;e Arti&#383;ts put upon
  it, to di&#383;clo&#383;e the colour we have been mentioning, that we
  have by forcing it up with <i>Sal Armoniack</i> obtain'd a Sublimate of a
  Blewi&#383;h Colour. Nay a famous Spagyri&#383;t affirms, that the very
  Mercury of it is green, but till he teach us an intelligible way of
  making &#383;uch a Mercury, we mu&#383;t content our&#383;elves to inform
  you, that we have had a Cupreous Body, that was Præcipitated out of a
  di&#383;till'd Liquor, that &#383;eem'd to be the <!-- Page 349 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349"></a>[pg 349]</span> the Sulphur of
  <i>Venus</i>, and &#383;eem'd even when flaming, of a Greeni&#383;h
  Colour. And indeed Copper is a Metall &#383;o ea&#383;ily wrought upon by
  Liquors of &#383;everal kinds, that I &#383;hould tell you, I know not
  any Mineral, that will concurr to the production of &#383;uch a variety
  of Colours as Copper di&#383;&#383;ol'd in &#383;everal
  <i>Men&#383;truums</i>, as Spirit of Vinegar, <i>Aqua fortis</i>, <i>Aqua
  Regis</i>, Spirit of Nitre, of Urine, of Soot, Oyls of &#383;everal
  kinds, and I know not how many other Liquors, if the variety of
  &#383;omewhat differing colours (that Copper will be made to
  a&#383;&#383;ume, as it is wrought upon by &#383;everal Liquors) were
  not comprehended within the Limits of Greeni&#383;h Blew, or Blewi&#383;h
  Green.</p>

  <p>And yet I mu&#383;t adverti&#383;e you (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) that being
  de&#383;irous to try if I could not make with crude Copper a Green
  Solution without the Blewi&#383;hne&#383;s that is wont to accompany its
  Vulgar Solutions, I bethought my &#383;elf of u&#383;ing two
  <i>Men&#383;truums</i>, which I had not known imploy'd to work on this
  Metall, and which I had certain Rea&#383;ons to make Tryal of, as I
  &#383;ucce&#383;sfully did. The one of the&#383;e Liquors (if I much
  mi&#383;remember not) was Spirit of Sugar di&#383;till'd in a Retort,
  which mu&#383;t be warily done, (if you will avoid breaking your <!--
  Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350"></a>[pg 350]</span>
  gla&#383;&#383;es) and the other, Oyl or Spirit of Turpentine, which
  affords a fine Green Solution that is u&#383;eful to me on &#383;everal
  occa&#383;ions. And yet to &#383;hew that the adventitious colour may
  re&#383;ult, as well from the true and permanent Copper it &#383;elf, as
  the Salts wherewith 'tis corroded, I &#383;hall add, that if you take a
  piece of good <i>Dantzick</i> Copperis, or any other Vitriol wherein
  <i>Venus</i> is prædominant, and having moi&#383;tened it in your Mouth,
  or with fair water, rubb it upon a whetted knife, or any other bright
  piece of Steel or Iron, it will (as we have formerly told you)
  pre&#383;ent'y &#383;tain the Steel with a Reddi&#383;h colour, like that
  of Copper, the rea&#383;on of which, we mu&#383;t not now &#383;tay to
  inquire.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation I.</i></p>

  <p>I pre&#383;ume you may have taken notice (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) that I
  have borrowed &#383;ome of the In&#383;tances mention'd in this
  47<sup>th</sup> Experiment, from the Laboratories of Chymi&#383;ts, and
  becau&#383;e in &#383;ome (though very few) other pa&#383;&#383;ages of
  this E&#383;&#383;ay, I have likewi&#383;e made u&#383;e of Experiments
  mention'd al&#383;o by &#383;ome Spagyrical Writers, I think it not
  ami&#383;s to repre&#383;ent to you on this Occa&#383;ion once for all,
  &#383;ome things be&#383;ides <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_351"></a>[pg 351]</span> those which I intimated in the
  præamble of this pre&#383;ent Experiment; For be&#383;ides, that 'tis
  very allowable for a Writer to repeat an Experiment which he invented
  not, in ca&#383;e he improve it; And be&#383;ides that many Experiments
  familiar to Chymi&#383;ts are unknown to the generality of Learned Men,
  who either never read Chymical proce&#383;&#383;es, or never
  under&#383;tood their meaning, or never dur&#383;t believe them;
  be&#383;ides the&#383;e things, I &#383;ay, I &#383;hall repre&#383;ent,
  That, as to the few Experiments I have borrowed from the Chymi&#383;ts,
  if they be very Vulgar, 'twould perhaps be difficult to a&#383;cribe each
  of them its own Author, and 'tis more than the generality of
  Chymi&#383;ts them&#383;elves can do: and if they be not of very known
  and familiar practi&#383;e among them, unle&#383;s the Authors wherein I
  found them had given me cau&#383;e to believe, them&#383;elves had try'd
  them, I know not why I might not &#383;et them down, as a part of the
  <i>Phænomena</i> of Colours which I pre&#383;ent you; Many things
  unanimou&#383;ly enough deliver'd as matters of fact by (I know not how
  many Chymical Writers) being not to be rely'd on, upon the &#383;ingle
  Authority of &#383;uch Authors: For In&#383;tance, as &#383;ome
  Spagyri&#383;ts deliver (perhaps among&#383;t &#383;everal deceitful
  proce&#383;&#383;es) that <i>Saccarum Saturni</i> <!-- Page 352 --><span

  Turpentine will afford a Bal&#383;om, &#383;o <i>Beguinus</i> and many
  more tell us, that the &#383;ame Concrete (<i>Saccarum Saturni</i>) will
  yield an incomparably fragrant Spirit, and a pretty Quantity of two
  &#383;everal Oyles, and yet &#383;ince many have complain'd, as well as I
  have done, that they could find no &#383;uch odoriferous, but rather an
  ill-&#383;ented Liquor, and &#383;carce any oyl in their
  Di&#383;tillation of that &#383;weet Vitriol, a wary per&#383;on would as
  little build any thing on what they &#383;ay of the former Experiment, as
  upon what they averr of the later, and therefore I &#383;crupled not to
  mention this Red Bal&#383;om of which I have not &#383;een any, (but what
  I made) among my other experiments about redne&#383;s.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annot. II.</i></p>

  <p>We have &#383;ometimes had the Curio&#383;ity to try what Colours
  Minerals, as Tingla&#383;s, Antimony, Spelter, &amp;c. would yield in
  &#383;everal <i>Men&#383;truums</i>, nor have we forborn to try the
  Colours of &#383;tones, of which that famous one, (which <i>Helmont</i>
  calls <i>Paracel&#383;us's Ludus</i>) though it be digg'd out of the
  Earth and &#383;eem a true &#383;tone, has afforded in
  <i>Men&#383;truums</i> capable to di&#383;&#383;olve &#383;o &#383;olid a
  &#383;tone, &#383;ometimes a Yellowi&#383;h, <!-- Page 353 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353"></a>[pg 353]</span> &#383;ometimes a
  Red &#383;olution of both which I can &#383;how you. But though I have
  from Minerals obtain'd with &#383;everal <i>Men&#383;truums</i> very
  differing Colours, and &#383;ome &#383;uch as perhaps you would be
  &#383;urpriz'd to &#383;ee drawn from &#383;uch Bodies: yet I mu&#383;t
  now pa&#383;s by the particulars, being de&#383;irous to put an End to
  this Treati&#383;e, before I put an end to your Patience and my own.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation III.</i></p>

  <p>And yet before I pa&#383;s to the next Experiment, I mu&#383;t put you
  in mind, that the Colours of Metals may in many ca&#383;es be further
  alter'd by imploying, either præcipitating Salts, or other convenient
  Sub&#383;tances to act upon their Solutions. Of this you may remember,
  that I have given you &#383;everal In&#383;tances already, to which may
  be added &#383;uch as the&#383;e, That if Quick&#383;ilver be
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd in <i>Aqua fortis</i>, and Præcipitated out of the
  Solution, either with water impregnated with Sea &#383;alt, or with the
  &#383;pirit of that Concrete, it falls to the Bottom in the form of a
  white powder, whereas if it be Præcipitated with an Alcaly, it will
  afford a Yellowi&#383;h or tawny powder, and if there be no Præcipitation
  made, and the <i>Men&#383;truum</i> be drawn off with a convenient <!--
  Page 354 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354"></a>[pg 354]</span>
  fire, the corroded Mercury will remain in the bottom, in the form of a
  &#383;ub&#383;tance that may be made to appear of differing Colours by
  differing degrees of Heat; As I remember that lately having
  purpo&#383;ely ab&#383;tracted <i>Aqua fortis</i> from &#383;ome
  Quick&#383;ilver that we had di&#383;&#383;olv'd in it, &#383;o that
  there remain'd a white <i>Calx</i>, expo&#383;ing that to &#383;everal
  degrees of Fire, and afterwards to a naked one, we obtain'd &#383;ome new
  Colours, and at length the greate&#383;t part of the <i>Calx</i> lying at
  the Bottome of the Vial, and being brought partly to a Deep Yellow, and
  partly to a Red Colour, the re&#383;t appear'd elevated to the upper part
  and neck of the Vial, &#383;ome in the form of a Reddi&#383;h, and
  &#383;ome of an A&#383;h-Colour Sublimate. But of the differing Colours
  which by differing wayes and working of Quick Silver with Fire, and
  Saline Bodies, may be produc'd in Precipitates, I may el&#383;ewhere have
  occa&#383;ion to take further notice. I al&#383;o told you not long
  &#383;ince, that if you corrode Quick-&#383;ilver with Oyl of Vitriol
  in&#383;tead of <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, and ab&#383;tract the
  <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, there will remain a White <i>Calx</i> which by the
  Affu&#383;ion of Fair Water pre&#383;ently turns into a Lemmon Colour.
  And ev'n the <i>Succedaneum</i> to a <i>Men&#383;truum</i> may
  &#383;ometimes &#383;erve the turn to change the Colours of a Metal. The
  lovely <!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355"></a>[pg
  355]</span> Red which Painters call Vermillion, is made of Mercury, which
  is of the Colour of Silver, and of Brim&#383;tone which is of Kin to that
  of Gold, Sublim'd up together in a certain proportion, as is vulgarly
  known to Spagyri&#383;ts.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XLVIII.</i></h3>

  <p>The third chief &#383;ort of the Adventitious Colours of Metals, is,
  that which is produc'd by a&#383;&#383;ociating them (e&#383;pecially
  when Calcin'd) with other fu&#383;ible Bodies, and Principally Venice,
  and other fine Gla&#383;s devoid of Colour.</p>

  <p>I have formerly given you an Example, whereby it may appear, that a
  Metal may impart to Gla&#383;s a Colour much differing from its own, when
  I told you, how with Silver, I had given Gla&#383;s a lovely Golden
  Colour. And I &#383;hall now add, that I have Learn'd from one of the
  Chief Artificers that &#383;ells Painted Gla&#383;s, that tho&#383;e of
  his Trade Colour it Yellow with a preparation of the <i>Calx</i> of
  Silver. Though having lately had occa&#383;ion among other Tryals to
  mingle a few grains of Shell-&#383;ilver (&#383;uch as is imploy'd with
  the Pen&#383;il and Pen) with a convenient proportion of powder'd
  Cry&#383;tal Gla&#383;s, having kept them two or three <!-- Page 356
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356"></a>[pg 356]</span> hours in
  fu&#383;ion, I was &#383;urpriz'd to find the Colliquated Ma&#383;s to
  appear upon breaking the Crucible of a lovely Saphirine Blew, which made
  me &#383;u&#383;pect my Servant might have brought me a wrong Crucible,
  but he con&#383;tantly affirm'd it to be the &#383;ame wherein the Silver
  was put, and con&#383;iderable Circum&#383;tances countenanc'd his
  A&#383;&#383;ertion, &#383;o that till I have opportunity to make farther
  Tryal, I cannot but &#383;u&#383;pect, either that Silver which is not
  (which is not very probable) brought to a perfect Fu&#383;ion and
  Colliquation with Gla&#383;s, may impart to it other Colours than when
  Neal'd upon it, or el&#383;e (which is le&#383;s unlikely) that though
  Silver Beaters u&#383;ually chu&#383;e the fine&#383;t Coyn they can get,
  as that which is mo&#383;t exten&#383;ive under the Hammer, yet the
  Silver-leaves of which this Shel-&#383;ilver was made, might retain
  &#383;o much Copper as to enable it to give the predominant tincture to
  the Gla&#383;s.</p>

  <p>For, I mu&#383;t proceed to tell you (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) as another
  in&#383;tance of the Adventitious Colours of Metals, that which is
  &#383;omething &#383;trange, Namely, That though Copper Calcin'd <i>per
  &#383;e</i> affords but a Dark and ba&#383;ely Colour'd <i>Calx</i>, yet
  the Gla&#383;smen do with it, as them&#383;elves inform me, Tinge their
  Gla&#383;s green. And I remember, that when once we took &#383;ome crude
  Copper, <!-- Page 357 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357"></a>[pg
  357]</span> and by frequent Ignition quenching it in Water had reduc'd it
  to a Dark and Ill-colour'd Powder, and afterward kept it in Fu&#383;ion
  in about a 100. times its weight of fine Gla&#383;s, we had, though not a
  Green, yet a Blew colour'd Ma&#383;s, which would perhaps have been
  Green, if we had hit right upon the Proportion of the Materials, and the
  Degree of Fire, and the Time wherein it ought to be kept in Fu&#383;ion,
  &#383;o plentifully does that Metal abound in a Venerial Tincture, as
  Arti&#383;ts call it, and in &#383;o many wayes does it
  di&#383;clo&#383;e that Richne&#383;s. But though Copper do as we have
  &#383;aid give &#383;omewhat near the like Colour to Gla&#383;s, which it
  does to <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, yet it &#383;eems worth inquiry, whether
  tho&#383;e new Colours which Mineral Bodies di&#383;clo&#383;e in melted
  Gla&#383;s, proceed from the Coalition of the Corpu&#383;cles of the
  Mineral with the Particles of the Gla&#383;s as &#383;uch, or from the
  Action (excited or actuated by fire) of the Alcalizate Salt (which is a
  main Ingredient of Gla&#383;s,) upon the Mineral Body, or from the
  concurrence of both the&#383;e Cau&#383;es, or el&#383;e from any other.
  But to return to that which we were &#383;aying, we may ob&#383;erve that
  <i>Putty</i> made by calcining together a proportion of Tin and Lead, as
  it is it &#383;elf a White <i>Calx</i>, &#383;o does it turn the <i>Pitta
  di Cry&#383;tallo</i> (as the <!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_358"></a>[pg 358]</span> Gla&#383;smen call the matter of the
  Purer &#383;ort of Gla&#383;s, wherewith it is Colliquated into a White
  Ma&#383;s, which if it be opacous enough is employ'd, as we
  el&#383;ewhere declare, for White Amel. But of the Colours which the
  other Metals may be made to produce in Colourle&#383;s Gla&#383;s, and
  other Vitrifiable Bodies, that have native Colours of their own, I
  mu&#383;t leave you to inform your &#383;elf upon Tryal, or at lea&#383;t
  mu&#383;t forbear to do it till another time, con&#383;idering how many
  Annotations are to follow, upon what has in this and the two former
  Experiments been &#383;aid already.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation I.</i></p>

  <p>When the Materials of Gla&#383;s being melted with Calcin'd Tin, have
  compos'd a Ma&#383;s Undiaphanous and White, this White Amel is as it
  were the Ba&#383;is of all tho&#383;e fine Concretes that Gold&#383;miths
  and &#383;everal Artificers imploy in the curious Art of Enamelling. For
  this White and Fu&#383;ible &#383;ub&#383;tance will receive into it
  &#383;elf, without &#383;poyling them, the Colours of divers other
  Mineral &#383;ub&#383;tances, which like it will indure the fire.</p>

<!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359"></a>[pg 359]</span>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation II.</i></p>

  <p>So that as by the pre&#383;ent (XLVIII.) Experiment it appears, that
  divers Minerals will impart to fu&#383;ible Ma&#383;&#383;es, Colours
  differing from their own; &#383;o by the making and compounding of Amels,
  it may appear, that divers Bodies will both retain their Colour in the
  fire, and impart the <i>&#383;ame</i> to &#383;ome others wherewith they
  were vitrifi'd, and in &#383;uch Tryals as that mention'd in the 17.
  Experiment, where I told you, that ev'n in Amels a Blew and Yellow will
  compound a Green. 'Tis pretty to behold, not only that &#383;ome Colours
  are of &#383;o fix'd a Nature, as to be capable of mixture without
  receiving any detriment by the fire, that do's &#383;o ea&#383;ily
  de&#383;troy or &#383;poyl tho&#383;e of other Bodies; but Mineral
  Pigments may be mingled by fire little le&#383;s regularly and
  &#383;ucce&#383;sfully, than in ordinary Dyeing Fatts, the vulgar Colours
  are wont to be mingled by the help of Water.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation III.</i></p>

  <p>'Tis not only Metalline, but other Mineral Bodies, that may be
  imploy'd, to give Tinctures unto Gla&#383;s (and 'tis worth noting <!--
  Page 360 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360"></a>[pg 360]</span>
  how &#383;mall a quantity of &#383;ome Mineral &#383;ub&#383;tances, will
  Tinge a Comparatively va&#383;t proportion of Gla&#383;s, and we have
  &#383;ometimes attempted to Colour Gla&#383;s, ev'n with Pretious Stones,
  and had cau&#383;e to think the Experiment not ca&#383;t away. And 'tis
  known by them that have look'd into the Art of Gla&#383;s, that the
  Artificers u&#383;e to tinge their Gla&#383;s Blew, with that Dark
  Mineral <i>Zaffora</i>, (&#383;ome of my Tryals on which I el&#383;ewhere
  acquaint you) which &#383;ome would have to be a Mineral Earth, others a
  Stone, and others neither the one, nor the other, but which is
  confe&#383;&#383;edly of a Dark, but not a Blew Colour, though it be not
  agreed of what particular Colour it is. 'Tis likewi&#383;e though a
  familiar yet a remarkable practi&#383;e among tho&#383;e that Deal in the
  making of Gla&#383;s, to imploy (as &#383;ome of them&#383;elves have
  inform'd me) what they call Mangane&#383;s, and &#383;ome Authors call
  <i>Magne&#383;ia</i> (of which I make particular mention in another
  Treati&#383;e) to exhibit in Gla&#383;s not only other Colours than its
  own, (which is &#383;o like in Darkne&#383;s or blacki&#383;hne&#383;s to
  the Load &#383;tone, that 'tis given by Minerali&#383;ts, for one of the
  Rea&#383;ons of its Latine Name) but Colours differing from one another.
  For though they u&#383;e it, (which is &#383;omewhat &#383;trange) to
  Clarifye their Gla&#383;s, and free <!-- Page 361 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361"></a>[pg 361]</span> it from that
  Blewi&#383;h Greeni&#383;h Colour, which el&#383;e it would too often be
  &#383;ubject to, yet they al&#383;o imploy it in certain proportions, to
  tinge their Gla&#383;s both with a Red colour, and with a Purpli&#383;h
  or Murry, and putting in a greater Quantity, they al&#383;o make with it
  that deep ob&#383;cure Gla&#383;s which is wont to pa&#383;s for Black,
  which agrees very well with, and may &#383;erve to confirm what we noted
  near the beginning of the 44<sup>th</sup> Experiment, of the &#383;eeming
  Blackne&#383;s of tho&#383;e Bodies that are overcharg'd with the
  Corpu&#383;cles of &#383;uch Colours, as Red, or Blew, or Green, &amp;c.
  And as by &#383;everal Metals and other Minerals we can give various
  Colours to Gla&#383;s, &#383;o on the other &#383;ide, by the differing
  Colours that Mineral Oars, or other Mineral Powders being melted with
  Gla&#383;s di&#383;clo&#383;e in it, a good Conjecture may be oftentimes
  made of the Metall or known Mineral, that the Oar propos'd, either holds,
  or is mo&#383;t of kin to. And this ea&#383;ie way of examining Oars, may
  be in &#383;ome ca&#383;es of good u&#383;e, and is not ill deliver'd by
  <i>Glauber</i>, to whom I &#383;hall at pre&#383;ent refer you, for a
  more particular account of it: unle&#383;s your Curio&#383;ity command
  al&#383;o what I have ob&#383;erv'd about the&#383;e matters; only I
  mu&#383;t here adverti&#383;e you, that great circum&#383;pection is <!--
  Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362"></a>[pg 362]</span>
  requi&#383;ite to keep this way from proving fallacious, upon the account
  of the variations of Colour that may be produc'd by the differing
  proportions that may be us'd betwixt the Oar and the Gla&#383;s, by the
  Richne&#383;s or Poorne&#383;s of the Oar it &#383;elf, by the Degree of
  Fire, and (e&#383;pecially) by the Length of Time, during which the
  matter is kept in fu&#383;ion; as you will ea&#383;ily gather from what
  you will quickly meet with in the following Annotation upon this
  pre&#383;ent 48<sup>th</sup> Experiment.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation IV.</i></p>

  <p>There is another way and differing enough from tho&#383;e already
  mention'd, by which Metalls may be brought to exhibit adventitious
  Colours: For by This, the Metall do's not &#383;o much impart a Colour to
  another Body, as receive a Colour from it, or rather both Bodies do by
  the new Texture re&#383;ulting from their mi&#383;tion produce a new
  Colour. I will not in&#383;i&#383;t to this purpo&#383;e upon the
  Examples afforded us by yellow Orpiment, and common Sea Salt, from which,
  &#383;ublim'd together, Chymi&#383;ts unanimou&#383;ly affirm their White
  or Cry&#383;talline Ar&#383;enick to be made: But 'tis not unworthy our
  noting, That though Yellow <!-- Page 363 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_363"></a>[pg 363]</span> Orpiment be acknowledg'd to be the
  Copiou&#383;e&#383;t by far of the two Ingredients of Ar&#383;enick, yet
  this la&#383;t nam'd Body being duely added to the highe&#383;t Colour'd
  Metall Copper, when 'tis in fu&#383;ion, gives it a whitene&#383;s both
  within and without. Thus <i>Lapis Calaminaris</i> changes and improves
  the Colour of Copper by turning it into Bra&#383;s. And I have
  &#383;ometimes by the help of Zinck duely mix'd after a certain manner,
  given Copper one of the Riche&#383;t Golden Colours that ever I have
  &#383;een the Be&#383;t true Gold Ennobled with. But pray have a care
  that &#383;uch Hints fall not into any hands that may mis-imploy
  them.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation V.</i></p>

  <p>Upon the Knowledge of the differing wayes of making Minerals and
  Metalls produce their adventitious Colours in Bodies capable of
  Vitrification, depends the pretty Art of making what Chymi&#383;ts by a
  Barbarous Word are pleas'd to call <i>Aman&#383;es</i>, that is
  counterfeit, or factitious Gemms, as Emeralds, Rubies, Saphires, Topazes,
  and the like. For in the making of the&#383;e, though pure Sand or
  Calcin'd Cry&#383;tal give the Body, yet 'tis for the mo&#383;t part
  &#383;ome Metalline or Mineral <i>Calx</i>, mingled in a <!-- Page 364
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364"></a>[pg 364]</span> small
  proportion that gives the Colour. But though I have many years &#383;ince
  taken delight, to divert my &#383;elf with this plea&#383;ing Art, and
  have &#383;een very pretty Productions of it, yet be&#383;ides that I
  fear I have now forgot mo&#383;t of the little Skill I had in it, this is
  no place to entertain you with what would rather take up an intire
  Di&#383;cour&#383;e, than be comprehended in an Annotation; wherefore the
  few things which I &#383;hall here take notice of to you, are only what
  belong to the pre&#383;ent Argument, Namely,</p>

  <p>Fir&#383;t, That I have often ob&#383;erv'd that Calcin'd Lead
  Colliquated with fine White Sand or Cry&#383;tal, reduc'd by ignitions
  and &#383;ub&#383;equent extinctions in Water to a &#383;ubtile Powder,
  will of it &#383;elf be brought by a due Decoction to give a cleer
  Ma&#383;s Colour'd like a <i>German</i> Amethy&#383;t. For though this
  gla&#383;s of Lead, is look'd upon by them that know no better way of
  making <i>Aman&#383;es</i>, as the grand Work of them all, yet which is
  an inconvenience that much blemi&#383;hes this way, the Calcin'd Lead it
  &#383;elf does not only afford matter to the <i>Aman&#383;es</i>, but has
  al&#383;o as well as other Metals a Colour of its own, which as I was
  &#383;aying, I have often found to be like that of <i>German</i> (as many
  call them) not Ea&#383;tern Amethy&#383;ts.</p>

  <p>Secondly, That neverthele&#383;s this Colour <!-- Page 365 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365"></a>[pg 365]</span> may be ea&#383;ily
  over-powr'd by tho&#383;e of divers other Mineral Pigments (if I may
  &#383;o call them) &#383;o that with a gla&#383;s of Lead, you may
  Emulate (for In&#383;tance) the fre&#383;h and lovely Greenne&#383;s of
  an Emerald, though in divers ca&#383;es the Colour which the Lead it
  &#383;elf upon Vitrification tends to, may vitiate that of the Pigment,
  which you would introduce into the Ma&#383;s.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, That &#383;o much ev'n the&#383;e Colours depend upon
  Texture, that in the Gla&#383;s of Lead it &#383;elf made of about three
  parts of <i>Lytharge</i> or <i>Minium</i> Colliquated with one of very
  finely Powder'd Cry&#383;tal or Sand, we have taken plea&#383;ure to make
  the mixture pa&#383;s through differing Colours, as we kept it more or
  le&#383;s in the Fu&#383;ion. For it was not u&#383;ually till after a
  pretty long Decoction that the Ma&#383;s attain'd to the Amethy&#383;tin
  Colour.</p>

  <p>Fourthly and la&#383;tly, That the degrees of Coction and other
  Circum&#383;tances may &#383;o vary the Colour produc'd in the &#383;ame
  ma&#383;s, that in a Crucible that was not great I have had fragments of
  the &#383;ame Ma&#383;s, in &#383;ome of which perhaps not &#383;o big as
  a Hazel-Nut, you may di&#383;cern four di&#383;tinct Colours.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation VI.</i></p>

  <p>You may remember (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) that when I mention'd the three
  &#383;orts of adventitious Colours of Metals, I mention'd them but as the
  chief, not the only. For there may be other wayes, which though they do
  not in &#383;o &#383;trict a &#383;en&#383;e belong to the adventitious
  Colours of Metals, may not inconveniently be reduc'd to them. And of
  the&#383;e I &#383;hall name now a couple, without denying that there may
  be more.</p>

  <p>The fir&#383;t may be drawn from the practi&#383;e of tho&#383;e that
  Dye Scarlet. For the famou&#383;e&#383;t Ma&#383;ter in that Art, either
  in <i>England</i> or <i>Holland</i>, has confe&#383;s'd to me, that
  neither others, nor he can &#383;trike that lovely Colour which is now
  wont to be call'd the <i>Bow-Dye</i>, without their Materials be Boyl'd
  in Ve&#383;&#383;els, either made of, or lin'd with a particular Metall.
  But of what I have known attempted in this kind, I mu&#383;t not as yet
  for fear of prejudicing or di&#383;plea&#383;ing others give you any
  particular Account.<a name="NtA_24"></a><a

  <p>The other way (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) of making Metals afford unobvious
  Colours, is by imbuing divers Bodies with Solutions of them made in their
  proper <i>Men&#383;truum's</i>, As (for <!-- Page 367 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367"></a>[pg 367]</span> In&#383;tance)
  though Copper plentifully di&#383;&#383;olv'd in <i>Aqua fortis</i>, will
  imbue &#383;everal Bodies with the Colour of the Solution; Yet Some other
  Metalls will not (as I el&#383;ewhere tell you) and have often try'd.
  Gold di&#383;&#383;olv'd in <i>Aqua Regia</i>, will, (which is not
  commonly known) Dye the Nails and Skin, and Hafts of Knives, and other
  things made of Ivory, not with a Golden, but a Purple Colour, which
  though it manife&#383;t it &#383;elf but &#383;lowly, is very durable,
  and &#383;carce ever to be wa&#383;h'd out. And if I mi&#383;remember
  not, I have already told you in this Treati&#383;e, that the purer
  Cry&#383;tals of fine Silver made with <i>Aqua fortis</i>, though they
  appear White, will pre&#383;ently Dye the Skin and Nails, with a Black,
  or at lea&#383;t a very Dark Colour, which Water will not wa&#383;h off,
  as it will ordinary Ink from the &#383;ame parts. And divers other Bodies
  may the Same way be Dy'd, &#383;ome of a Black, and others of a
  Blacki&#383;h Colour.</p>

  <p>And as Metalline, &#383;o likewi&#383;e Mineral Solutions may produce
  Colours differing enough from tho&#383;e of the Liquors them&#383;elves.
  I &#383;hall not fetch an Example of this, from what we daily &#383;ee
  happen in the powdring of Beef, which by the Brine imploy'd about it
  (e&#383;pecially if the fle&#383;h be <!-- Page 368 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368"></a>[pg 368]</span> over &#383;alted)
  do's oftentimes appear at our Tables of a Green, and &#383;ometimes of a
  Reddi&#383;h Colour, (deep enough) nor &#383;hall I in&#383;i&#383;t on
  the practi&#383;e of &#383;ome that deal in Salt Petre, who, (as I
  &#383;u&#383;pected, and as them&#383;elves acknowledg'd to me) do, with
  the mixture of a certain proportion of that; and common Salt, give a fine
  Redne&#383;s, not only to Neats Tongues, but which is more pretty as well
  as difficult, to &#383;uch fle&#383;h, as would otherwi&#383;e be purely
  White; The&#383;e Examples, I &#383;ay, I &#383;hall decline
  in&#383;i&#383;ting on, as chu&#383;ing rather to tell you, that I have
  &#383;everal times try'd, that a Solution of the Sulphur of Vitriol, or
  ev'n of common Sulphur, though the Liquor appear'd clear enough, would
  immediately tinge a piece of new Coin, or other clean Silver,
  &#383;ometimes with a Golden, &#383;ometimes with a deeper, and more
  Reddi&#383;h colour, according to the &#383;trength of the Solution, and
  the quantity of it, that chanc'd to adhere to the Metall; which may take
  off your wonder that the water of the hot Spring at <i>Bath</i>,
  abounding with di&#383;&#383;olv'd Sub&#383;tances of a very Sulphureous
  Nature, &#383;hould for a while, as it were gild, the new or clean pieces
  of Silver coyn, that are for a due time immers'd in it. And to the&#383;e
  may be added tho&#383;e formerly mention'd Examples <!-- Page 369
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369"></a>[pg 369]</span> of the
  adventitious Colours of Mineral Bodies; which brings into my mind, that,
  ev'n Vegetable Liquors, whether by degeneration, or by altering the
  Texture of the Body that imbibes them, may &#383;tain other Bodies with
  Colours differing enough, from their own, of which very good
  Herbari&#383;ts have afforded us a notable Example, by affirming that the
  Juice of <i>Alcanna</i> being green (in which &#383;tate I could never
  here procure it) do's yet Dye the Skin and Nails of a La&#383;ting Red.
  But I &#383;ee this Treati&#383;e is like to prove too bulky without the
  addition of further In&#383;tances of this Nature.</p>

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT XLIX.</i></h3>

  <p>Meeting the other day, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, in an <i>Italian</i> book,
  that treats of other matters, with a way of preparing what the Author
  calls a <i>Lacca</i> of Vegetables, by which the <i>Italians</i> mean a
  kind of Extract fit for Painting, like that rich <i>Lacca</i> in
  Engli&#383;h commonly call'd <i>Lake</i>, which is imploy'd by Painters
  as a glorious Red. And finding the Experiment not to be
  incon&#383;iderable, and very defectively &#383;et down, it will not be
  ami&#383;s to acquaint you with what &#383;ome Tryals have inform'd us,
  in reference to this <!-- Page 370 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_370"></a>[pg 370]</span> Experiment, which both by our Italian
  Author, and by divers of his Countrymen, is look'd upon as no trifling
  Secret.</p>

  <p>Take then the root call'd in Latin <i>Curcuma</i>, and in Engli&#383;h
  Turmerick, (which I made u&#383;e of, becau&#383;e it was then at hand,
  and is among Vegetables fit for that purpo&#383;e one of the mo&#383;t
  ea&#383;ie&#383;t to be had) and when it is beaten, put what Quantity of
  it you plea&#383;e into fair Water, adding to every pound of Water about
  a &#383;poonfull or better of as &#383;trong a <i>Lixivium</i> or
  Solution of Pota&#383;hes as you can well make, clarifying it by
  Filtration before you put it to the Decocting water. Let the&#383;e
  things boyl, or rather &#383;imper over a &#383;oft Fire in a clean
  glaz'd Earthen Ve&#383;&#383;el, till you find by the Immer&#383;ion of a
  &#383;heet of White Paper (or by &#383;ome other way of Tryal) that the
  Liquor is &#383;ufficiently impregnated with the Golden Tincture of the
  Turmerick, then take the Decoction off the Fire, and Filter or Strain it
  that it may be clean, and lei&#383;urely dropping into it a &#383;trong
  Solution of Roch Allum, you &#383;hall find the Decoction as it were
  curdl'd, and the tincted part of it either to emerge, to
  &#383;ub&#383;ide, or to &#383;wim up and down, like little Yellow
  flakes; and if you pour this mixture into a Tunnel lin'd with Cap Paper,
  the Liquor that Filtred formerly <!-- Page 371 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371"></a>[pg 371]</span> &#383;o Yellow,
  will now pa&#383;s clean thorow the Filtre, leaving its tincted, and as
  it were curdled parts in the Filtre, upon which fair Water mu&#383;t be
  &#383;o often pour'd, till you have Dulcifi'd the matter therein
  contain'd, the &#383;ign of which Dulcification is (you know) when the
  Water that has pa&#383;s'd through it, comes from it as
  ta&#383;tele&#383;s as it was pour'd on it. And if without Filtration you
  would gather together the flakes of this Vegetable Lake, you mu&#383;t
  pour a great Quantity of fair Water upon the Decoction after the
  affu&#383;ion of the Alluminous Solution, and you &#383;hall find the
  Liquor to grow clearer, and the Lake to &#383;ettle together at the
  bottom, or emerge to the top of the Water, though &#383;ometimes having
  not pour'd out a &#383;ufficient Quantity of fair Water, we have
  ob&#383;erv'd the Lake partly to &#383;ub&#383;ide, and partly to emerge,
  leaving all the middle of the Liquor clear. But to make this Lake fit for
  u&#383;e, it mu&#383;t by repeated affu&#383;ions of fre&#383;h Water, be
  Dulcifi'd from the adhering Salts, as well as that &#383;eparated by
  Filtration, and be &#383;pread and &#383;uffer'd to dry lei&#383;urely
  upon pieces of Cloth, with Brown Paper, or Chalk, or Bricks under <!--

<p class="center"><i>Annotation I.</i></p>

  <p>Whereas it is pre&#383;um'd that the Magi&#383;tery of Vegetables
  obtain'd this way con&#383;i&#383;ts but of the more Soluble and Coloured
  parts of the Plants that afford it, I mu&#383;t take the liberty to
  Que&#383;tion the &#383;uppo&#383;ition. And for my &#383;o doing, I
  &#383;hall give you this account.</p>

  <p>According to the Notions (&#383;uch as they were) that I had
  concerning Salts; Allom, though to &#383;en&#383;e a Homogeneous Body,
  ought not to be reckon'd among true Salts, but to be it &#383;elf look'd
  upon as a kind of Magi&#383;tery, in regard that as Native Vitriol (for
  &#383;uch I have had) contains both a Saline &#383;ub&#383;tance and a
  Metall, whether Copper, or Iron, corroded by it, and a&#383;&#383;ociated
  with it; &#383;o Allom which may be of &#383;o near a kin to Vitriol,
  that in &#383;ome places of <i>England</i> (as we are a&#383;&#383;ur'd
  by good Authority the &#383;ame &#383;tone will <!-- Page 373 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373"></a>[pg 373]</span> &#383;ometimes
  afford both) &#383;eems manife&#383;tly to contain a peculiar kind of
  Acid Spirit, generated in the Bowels of the Earth, and &#383;ome kind of
  &#383;tony matter di&#383;&#383;olv'd by it. And though in making our
  ordinary Allom, the Workmen u&#383;e the A&#383;hes of a Sea Weed
  (vulgarly call'd Kelp) and Urine: yet tho&#383;e that &#383;hould know,
  inform us, that, here in <i>England</i>, there is be&#383;ides the
  factitious Allom, Allom made by Nature Without the help of tho&#383;e
  Additaments. Now (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) when I con&#383;ider'd this
  compo&#383;ition of Allom, and that Alcalizate Salts are wont to
  Præcipitate what acid Salts have di&#383;&#383;olv'd, I could not but be
  prone to &#383;u&#383;pect that the Curdled Matter, which is call'd the
  Magi&#383;tery of Vegetables, may have in it no incon&#383;iderable
  proportion of a &#383;tony &#383;ub&#383;tance Præcipitated out of the
  Allom by the <i>Lixivium</i>, wherein the Vegetable had been decocted,
  and to &#383;hew you, that there is no nece&#383;&#383;ity, that all the
  curdl'd &#383;ub&#383;tance mu&#383;t belong to the Vegetable, I
  &#383;hall add, that I took a &#383;trong Solution of Allom, and having
  Filtred it, by pouring in a convenient Quantity of a &#383;trong Solution
  of Pota&#383;hes, I pre&#383;ently, as I expected, turn'd the mixture
  into a kind of white Curds, which being put to Filtre, the Paper retain'd
  a &#383;tony <!-- Page 374 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_374"></a>[pg 374]</span> <i>Calx</i>, copious enough, very
  White, and which &#383;eem'd to be of a Mineral Nature, both by &#383;ome
  other &#383;ignes, and this, that little Bits of it being put upon a live
  Coal, which was Gently Blown whil&#383;t they were on it, they did
  neither melt nor fly away, and you may keep a Quantity of this White
  &#383;ub&#383;tance for a good while, (nay for ought I can gue&#383;s for
  a very long one) in a red hot Crucible without lo&#383;ing or
  &#383;poiling it; nor did hot Water wherein I purpo&#383;ely kept another
  parcel of &#383;uch <i>Calx</i>, &#383;eem to do any more than wa&#383;h
  away the loo&#383;er adhering Salts from the &#383;tony
  &#383;ub&#383;tance, which therefore &#383;eem'd unlikely to be
  &#383;eparable by ablutions (though reiterated) from the Præcipitated
  parts of the Vegetable, who&#383;e Lake is intended. And to &#383;hew
  you, that there is likewi&#383;e in Allom a Body, with which the fix'd
  Salt of the Alcalizate Solution will concoagulate into a Saline
  Sub&#383;tance differing from either of them, I &#383;hall add, that I
  have taken plea&#383;ure to recover out of the &#383;lowly exhal'd
  Liquor, that pa&#383;s'd through the filtre, and left the foremention'd
  <i>Calx</i> behind, a Body that at lea&#383;t &#383;eem'd a Salt very
  pretty to look on, as being very White, and con&#383;i&#383;ting of an
  innumerable company of exceeding &#383;lender, and &#383;hining
  Particles, which <!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_375"></a>[pg 375]</span> would in part ea&#383;ily melt at the
  flame of a Candle, and in part flye away with &#383;ome little
  noi&#383;e. But of this &#383;ub&#383;tance, and its odd Qualities more
  perhaps el&#383;ewhere; for now I &#383;hall only take notice to you,
  that I have likewi&#383;e with Urinous Salts, &#383;uch as the Spirit of
  Sal Armoniack, as well as with the Spirit of Urine it &#383;elf, Nay, (if
  I much mi&#383;take not) ev'n with Stale Urine undi&#383;til'd,
  ea&#383;ily Precipitated &#383;uch a White <i>Calx</i> as I was formerly
  &#383;peaking of, out of a Limpid Solution of Allom, &#383;o that there
  is need of Circum&#383;pection in judging of the Natures of Liquors by
  Precipitations wherein Allom intervenes, el&#383;e we may &#383;ometimes
  mi&#383;takingly imagine that to be Precipitated out of a Liquor by
  Allom, which is rather Precipitated out of Allom by the Liquor: And this
  puts me in mind to tell you, that 'tis not unplea&#383;ant to behold how
  quickly the Solution of Allom (or injected lumps of Allom) do's
  occa&#383;ion the &#383;evering of the colour'd parts of the Decoction
  from the Liquor that &#383;eem'd to have &#383;o perfectly imbib'd
  them.</p>

<!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376"></a>[pg 376]</span>

<p class="center"><i>Annot. II.</i></p>

  <p>The above mention'd way of making Lakes we have tryed not only with
  Turmerick, but al&#383;o with Madder, which yielded us a Red Lake; and
  with Rue, which afforded us an extract, of (almo&#383;t if not
  altogether) the &#383;ame Colour with that of the leaves.</p>

  <p>But in regard that 'tis Principally the Alcalizate Salt of the
  Pot-a&#383;hes, which enables the water to Extract &#383;o powerfully the
  Tincture of the Decocted Vegetables, I fear that our Author may be
  mi&#383;taken by &#383;uppo&#383;ing that the Decoction will alwayes be
  of the very &#383;ame Colour with the Vegetable it is made off. For
  Lixiviate Salts, to which Pot-a&#383;hes eminently belong, though by
  peircing and opening the Bodies of Vegetables, they prepare and
  di&#383;po&#383;e them to part readily with their Tincture, yet &#383;ome
  Tinctures they do not only draw out, but likewi&#383;e alter them, as may
  be ea&#383;ily made appear by many of the Experiments already &#383;et
  down in this Treati&#383;e, and though Allom being of an Acid Nature, its
  Solutions may in &#383;ome Ca&#383;es de&#383;troy the Adventitious
  Colours produc'd by the Alcaly, and re&#383;tore the former: yet <!--
  Page 377 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377"></a>[pg 377]</span>
  be&#383;ides that Allom is not, as I have lately &#383;hown, a meer Acid
  Salt, but a mixt Body, and be&#383;ides, that its operations are languid
  in compari&#383;on of the activity of Salts freed by Di&#383;tillation,
  or by Incineration and Di&#383;&#383;olution, from the mo&#383;t of their
  Earthy parts, we have &#383;een already Examples, that in divers
  Ca&#383;es an Acid Salt will not re&#383;tore a Vegetable
  &#383;ub&#383;tance to the Colour of which an Alcalizate one had depriv'd
  it, but makes it a&#383;&#383;ume a third very differing from both, as we
  formerly told you, that if Syrrup of Violets were by an Alcaly turn'd
  Green, (which Colour, as I have try'd, may be the &#383;ame way produc'd
  in the Violet-leaves them&#383;elves without any Relation to a Syrrup) an
  Acid Salt would not make it Blew again, but Red. And though I have by
  this way of making Lakes, made Magi&#383;teries (for &#383;uch they
  &#383;eem to be) of Brazil, and as I remember of Cochinele it &#383;elf,
  and of other things, Red, Yellow or Green which Lakes were enobled with a
  Rich Colour, and others had no bad one; yet in &#383;ome the colour of
  the Lake &#383;eem'd rather inferiour than otherwi&#383;e to that of the
  Plant, and in others it &#383;eem'd both very differing, and much
  wor&#383;e; but Writing this in a time and place where I cannot provide
  my &#383;elf of Flowres and other Vegetables to pro&#383;ecute <!-- Page
  378 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378"></a>[pg 378]</span>
  &#383;uch Tryals in a competent variety of Subjects, I am content not to
  be po&#383;itive in delivering a judgment of this way of Lakes, till
  Experience, or You, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, &#383;hall have afforded me a
  fuller and more particular Information.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annotation III.</i></p>

  <p>And on this occa&#383;ion (<i>Pyrophilus</i>) I mu&#383;t here (having
  forgot to do it &#383;ooner) adverti&#383;e you once for all, that having
  written &#383;everal of the foregoing Experiments, not only in ha&#383;te
  but at &#383;ea&#383;ons of the year, and in places wherein I could not
  furni&#383;h my &#383;elf with &#383;uch In&#383;truments, and &#383;uch
  a variety of Materials, as the de&#383;ign of giving you an Introduction
  into the Hi&#383;tory of Colours requir'd, it can &#383;carce be
  otherwi&#383;e but that divers of the Experiments, that I have &#383;et
  down, may afford you &#383;ome matter of new Tryals, if you think fit to
  &#383;upply the deficiencies of &#383;ome of them (e&#383;pecially the
  fre&#383;hly mention'd about Lakes, and tho&#383;e that concern
  Emphatical Colours) which deficiencies for want of being befriended with

  <p>The u&#383;e of Allom is very great as well as familiar in the Dyers
  Trade, and I have not been ill pleas'd with the u&#383;e I have been able
  to make of it in preparing other pigments than tho&#383;e they imploy
  with Vegetable Juices. But the Lucriferous practi&#383;es of Dyers and
  other Trade&#383;men, I do, for Rea&#383;ons that you may know when you
  plea&#383;e, purpo&#383;ely forbear in this E&#383;&#383;ay, though not
  &#383;trictly from pointing at, yet from making it a part of my
  pre&#383;ent work explicitly and circum&#383;tantially to deliver,
  e&#383;pecially &#383;ince I now find (though late and not without
  &#383;ome Blu&#383;hes at my prolixity) that what I intended but for a

<h3><i>EXPERIMENT L.</i></h3>

  <p>Yet here, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, I mu&#383;t take leave to in&#383;ert an
  Experiment, though perhaps you'l think its coming in here an
  Intru&#383;ion, For I confe&#383;s its more proper place would have been
  among tho&#383;e Experiments, that were brought as proofs and
  applications of our Notions concerning the differences of <!-- Page 380
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380"></a>[pg 380]</span> Salts;
  but not having remembred to in&#383;ert it in its fitte&#383;t place, I
  had rather take notice of it in this, than leave it quite unmention'd:
  partly becau&#383;e it doth &#383;omewhat differ from the re&#383;t of
  our Experiments about Colours, in the way whereby 'tis made; and partly
  becau&#383;e the grounds upon which I devis'd it, may hint to you
  &#383;omewhat of the Method I u&#383;e in De&#383;igning and Varying
  Experiments about Colours, and upon this account I &#383;hall inform you,
  not only What I did, but Why I did it.</p>

  <p>I con&#383;ider'd then that the work of the former Experiments was
  either to change the Colour of a Body into another, or quite to
  de&#383;troy it, without giving it a &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;or, but I had
  a mind to give you al&#383;o a way, whereby to turn a Body endued with
  one Colour into two Bodies, of Colours, as well as
  con&#383;i&#383;tencies, very di&#383;tinct from each other, and that by
  the help of a Body that had it &#383;elf no Colour at all. In order to
  this, I remembred, that finding the Acidity of Spirit of Vinegar to be
  wholly de&#383;troy'd by its working upon <i>Minium</i> (or calcin'd
  Lead) whereby the Saline particles of the <i>Men&#383;truum</i> have
  their Ta&#383;te and Nature quite alter'd, I had, among other Conjectures
  I had built upon that change, rightly concluded, that the Solution of
  Lead <!-- Page 381 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381"></a>[pg
  381]</span> in Spirit of Vinegar would alter the Colour of the Juices and
  Infu&#383;ions of Several Plants, much after the like manner that I had
  found Oyl of Tartar to do; and accordingly I was quickly &#383;atisfied
  upon Tryal, that the Infu&#383;ion of Ro&#383;e-leaves would by a
  &#383;mall quantity of this Solution well mingl'd with it, be immediately
  turn'd into a &#383;omewhat &#383;ad Green.</p>

  <p>And further, I had often found, that Oyl of Vitriol, though a potently
  Acid <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, will yet Præcipitate many Bodies, both
  Mineral and others, di&#383;&#383;olv'd not onely in <i>Aqua fortis</i>
  (as &#383;ome Chymi&#383;ts have ob&#383;erv'd) but particularly in
  Spirit of Vinegar, and I have further found, that the <i>Calces</i> or
  Powders Præcipitated by this Liquor were u&#383;ually fair and White.</p>

  <p>Laying the&#383;e things together, 'twas not difficult to conclude,
  that if upon a good Tincture of Red Ro&#383;e-leaves made with fair
  Water, I dropp'd a pretty quantity of a &#383;trong and &#383;weet
  Solution of <i>Minium</i>, the Liquor would be turn'd into the like muddy
  Green Sub&#383;tance, as I have formerly intimated to You, that Oyl of
  Tartar would reduce it to, and that if then I added a convenient quantity
  of good Oyl of Vitriol, this la&#383;t nam'd Liquor would have two
  di&#383;tinct operations upon the Mixture, the one, that <!-- Page 382
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382"></a>[pg 382]</span> it would
  Præcipitate that re&#383;olv'd Lead in the form of a White Powder; the
  other, that it would Clarifie the muddy Mixture, and both re&#383;tore,
  and exceedingly heighten the Redne&#383;s of the Infu&#383;ion of
  Ro&#383;es, which was the mo&#383;t copious Ingredient of the Green
  compo&#383;ition, and accordingly trying the Experiment in a Wine
  gla&#383;s &#383;harp at the bottom (like an inverted Cone) that the
  &#383;ub&#383;iding Powder might &#383;eem to take up the more room, and
  be the more con&#383;picuous, I found that when I had &#383;haken the
  Green Mixture, that the colour'd Liquor might be the more equally
  di&#383;per&#383;ed, a few drops of the rectifi'd Oyl of Vitriol did
  pre&#383;ently turn the opacous Liquor into one that was cleer and Red,
  almo&#383;t like a Rubie, and threw down good &#383;tore of a Powder,
  which when 'twas &#383;ettl'd, would have appear'd very White, if
  &#383;ome inter&#383;pers'd Particles of the red Liquor had not a little
  Allay'd the Purity, though not blemi&#383;h'd the Beauty of the Colour.
  And to &#383;hew you, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, that the&#383;e Effects do not
  flow from the Oyl of Vitriol, as it is &#383;uch, but as it is a
  &#383;trongly Acid <i>Men&#383;truum</i>, that has the property both to
  Præcipitate Lead, as well as &#383;ome other Concretes out of Spirit of
  Vinegar, and to heighten the Colour of Red Ro&#383;e-leaves, I add, that
  I <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383"></a>[pg
  383]</span> have done the &#383;ame thing, though perhaps not quite
  &#383;o well with Spirit of Salt, and that I could not do it with
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, becau&#383;e though that potent <i>Men&#383;truum</i>
  does as well as the others heighthen the Redne&#383;s of Ro&#383;es, yet
  it would not like them Precipitate Lead out of Spirit of Vinegar, but
  would rather have di&#383;&#383;olv'd it, if it had not found it
  di&#383;&#383;olv'd already.</p>

  <p>And as by this way we have produc'd a Red Liquor, and a White
  Precipitate out of a Dirty Green magi&#383;tery of Ro&#383;e-leaves,
  &#383;o by the &#383;ame Method, you may produce a fair Yellow, and
  &#383;ometimes a Red Liquor, and the like Precipitate, out of an
  Infu&#383;ion of a curious Purple Colour. For you may call to mind, that
  in the Annotation upon the 39<sup>th</sup>. Experiment I intimated to
  you, that I had with a few drops of an Alcaly turn'd the Infu&#383;ion of
  Logg-wood into a lovely Purple. Now if in&#383;tead of this Alcaly I
  &#383;ub&#383;tituted a very Strong and well Filtrated Solution of
  <i>Minium</i>, made with Spirit of Vinegar, and put about half as much of
  this Liquor as there was of the Infu&#383;ion of Logg-wood, (that the
  mixture might afford a pretty deal of Precipitate,) the affu&#383;ion of
  a convenient proportion of Spirit of Salt, would (if the Liquors were
  well and nimbly &#383;tirr'd together) pre&#383;ently <!-- Page 384
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384"></a>[pg 384]</span>
  &#383;trike down a Precipitate like that formerly mention'd, and turn the
  Liquor that &#383;wam above it, for the mo&#383;t part into a lovely
  Yellow.</p>

  <p>But for the advancing of this Experiment a little further, I
  con&#383;ider'd, that in ca&#383;e I fir&#383;t turn'd a &#383;poonfull
  of the infu&#383;ion of Logg-wood Purple, by a convenient proportion of
  the Solution of <i>Minium</i>, the Affu&#383;ion of Spirit of Sal
  Armnoniack, would Precipitate the Corpu&#383;cles of Lead conceal'd in
  the Solution of <i>Minium</i>, and yet not de&#383;troy the Purple colour
  of the Liquor; whereupon I thus proceeded; I took about a &#383;poonfull
  of the <i>fre&#383;h</i> Tincture of Logg-wood, (for I found that if it
  were <i>&#383;tale</i> the Experiment would not alwayes &#383;ucceed,)
  and having put to it a convenient proportion of the Solution of
  <i>Minium</i> to turn it into a deep and almo&#383;t opacous Purple, I
  then drop'd in as much Spirit of Sal Armoniack, as I gue&#383;s'd would
  Precipitate about half or more (but not all) of the Lead, and immediately
  &#383;tirring the mixture well together, I mingled the Precipitated parts
  with the others, &#383;o that they fell to the bottom, partly in the form
  of a Powder, and partly in the form of a Curdled Sub&#383;tance, that (by
  rea&#383;on of the Predominancy of the Ting'd Corpu&#383;cles over <!--
  Page 385 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385"></a>[pg 385]</span>
  the White) retain'd as well as the Supernatant Liquor; a Blewi&#383;h
  Purple colour &#383;ufficiently Deep, and then in&#383;tantly (but yet
  Warily,) pouring on a pretty Quantity of Spirit of Salt, the matter
  fir&#383;t Precipitated, was, by the above &#383;pecified figure of the
  bottome of the Gla&#383;s pre&#383;erv'd from being reach'd by the
  Spirituous Salt; which ha&#383;tily Precipitated upon it a new Bed (if I
  may &#383;o call it) of White Powder, being the remaining Corpu&#383;cles
  of the Lead, that the Urinous Spirit had not &#383;truck down: So that
  there appear'd in the Gla&#383;s three di&#383;tinct and very differingly
  colour'd Sub&#383;tances; a Purple or Violet-colour'd Precipitate at the
  bottom, a White and Carnation (&#383;ometimes a Variou&#383;ly colour'd)
  Precipitate over That, and at the Top of all a Tran&#383;parent Liquor of
  a lovely Yellow, or Red.</p>

  <p>Thus you &#383;ee, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, that though to &#383;ome I may
  have &#383;eem'd to have lighted on this (50<sup>th</sup>.) Experiment by
  chance, and though others may imagine, that to have excogitated it,
  mu&#383;t have proceeded from &#383;ome extraordinary in&#383;ight into
  the nature of Colours, yet indeed, the devi&#383;ing of it need not be
  look'd upon as any great matter, e&#383;pecially to one that is a little
  vers'd in the notions, I have in the&#383;e, and other Papers <!-- Page
  386 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386"></a>[pg 386]</span>
  hinted concerning the differences of Salts. And perhaps I might add upon
  more than conjecture, that the&#383;e very notions and &#383;ome
  particulars &#383;catteringly deliver'd in this Treati&#383;e, being
  skilfully put together, may &#383;ugge&#383;t divers matters (at
  lea&#383;t,) about Colours, that will not be altogether De&#383;picable.
  But tho&#383;e hinted, <i>Pyrophilus</i>, I mu&#383;t now leave &#383;uch
  as You to pro&#383;ecute, having already &#383;pent farr more time than I
  intended to allow my &#383;elf in acquainting You with particular
  Experiments and Ob&#383;ervations concerning the changes of Colour, to
  which I might have added many more, but that I hope I may have
  pre&#383;ented You with a competent number to make out in &#383;ome
  mea&#383;ure what I have at the beginning of this E&#383;&#383;ay either
  propos'd as my De&#383;ign in this Tract, or deliver'd as my Conjectures
  concerning the&#383;e matters. And it not being my pre&#383;ent
  De&#383;igne, as I have more than once Declar'd, to deliver any
  Po&#383;itive Hypothe&#383;is or &#383;olemn Theory of Colours, but only
  to furni&#383;h You with &#383;ome Experiments towards the framing of
  &#383;uch a Theory; I &#383;hall add nothing to what I have &#383;aid
  already, but a reque&#383;t that you would not be forward to think I have
  been mi&#383;taken in any thing I have deliver'd as matter of Fact
  concerning the changes of Colours, in ca&#383;e you <!-- Page 387
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387"></a>[pg 387]</span>
  &#383;hould not every time you trye it, find it exactly to &#383;ucceed.
  For be&#383;ides the Contingencies to which we have el&#383;ewhere
  &#383;hewn &#383;ome other Experiments to be obnoxious, the
  omi&#383;&#383;ion or variation of a &#383;eemingly uncon&#383;iderable
  circum&#383;tance, may hinder the &#383;ucce&#383;s of an Experiment,
  wherein no other fault has been committed. Of which truth I &#383;hall
  only give you that &#383;ingle and almo&#383;t obvious, but yet
  illu&#383;trious in&#383;tance of the Art of Dying Scarlets, for though
  you &#383;hould &#383;ee every Ingredient that is us'd about it, though I
  &#383;hould particularly inform You of the weight of each, and though you
  &#383;hould be pre&#383;ent at the kindling of the fire, and at the
  increa&#383;ing and remitting of it, when ever the degree of Heat is to
  be alter'd, and though (in a word) you &#383;hould &#383;ee every thing
  done &#383;o particularly that you would &#383;carce harbour the
  lea&#383;t doubt of your comprehending the whole Art: Yet if I
  &#383;hould not di&#383;clo&#383;e to You, that the Ve&#383;&#383;els,
  that immediately contain the Tinging Ingredients, are to be made of or to
  be lin'd with Tin, You would never be able by all that I could tell you
  el&#383;e (at-lea&#383;t, if the Famou&#383;e&#383;t and Candide&#383;t
  Artificers do not &#383;trangely delude them&#383;elves) to bring your
  Tincture of <!-- Page 388 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_388"></a>[pg 388]</span> Chochinele to Dye a perfect Scarlet.
  So much depends upon the very Ve&#383;&#383;el, wherein the Tinging
  matters are boyl'd, and &#383;o great an Influence may an unheeded
  Circum&#383;tance have on the Succe&#383;s of Experiments concerning
  Colours.</p>

  Hough Sir <i>Robert Morray</i> and Mon&#383;ieur <i>Zulichem</i> be
  Per&#383;ons that have de&#383;erv'd &#383;o well of the Commonwealth of
  Learning, that I &#383;hould think my &#383;elf unworthy to be look'd
  upon as a Member of it, if I declin'd to Obey them, or to Serve them; yet
  I &#383;hould not without Reluctancy &#383;end you the Notes, you
  de&#383;ire for him, if I did not hope that you will tran&#383;mit
  together with them, &#383;ome Account why they are not le&#383;s unworthy
  of his peru&#383;al; which, that you may do; I mu&#383;t inform you, how
  <!-- Page 392 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392"></a>[pg
  392]</span> the writing of them was Occa&#383;ion'd, which in &#383;hort
  was thus. As I was ju&#383;t going out of Town, hearing that an Ingenious
  Gentleman of my Acquaintance, lately return'd from <i>Italy</i>, had a
  Diamond, that being rubb'd, would &#383;hine in the Dark, and that he was
  not far off, I &#383;natch'd time from my Occa&#383;ions to make him a
  Vi&#383;it, but finding him ready to go abroad, and having in vain try'd
  to make the Stone yield any Light in the Day time, I borrow'd it of him
  for that Night, upon condition to re&#383;tore it him within a Day or two
  at furthe&#383;t, at <i>Gre&#383;ham</i> College, where we appointed to
  attend the meeting of the Society, that was then to be at that place. And
  hereupon I ha&#383;ted that Evening out of Town, and finding after Supper
  that the Stone which in the Day time would afford no di&#383;cernable
  Light, was really Con&#383;picuous in the Dark, I was &#383;o taken with
  the Novelty, and &#383;o de&#383;irous to make &#383;ome u&#383;e of an
  opportunity that was like to la&#383;t &#383;o little a while, that
  though at that time I had no body to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t me but a
  Foot-Boy, yet &#383;itting up late, I made a &#383;hift that Night to try
  a pretty number of &#383;uch of the things that then came into my
  thoughts, as were not in that place and time unpracticable. And the next
  Day being otherwi&#383;e imploy'd, <!-- Page 393 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393"></a>[pg 393]</span> I was fain to make
  u&#383;e of a drow&#383;ie part of the Night to &#383;et down
  ha&#383;tily in Writing what I had ob&#383;erv'd, and without having the
  time in the Morning, to &#383;tay the tran&#383;cribing of it, I order'd
  the Ob&#383;ervations to be brought after me to <i>Gre&#383;ham</i>
  College, where you may remember, that they were together with the Stone
  it &#383;elf &#383;hown to the Royal Society, by which they had the good
  Fortune not to be di&#383;lik'd, though &#383;everal things were through
  ha&#383;t omitted, &#383;ome of which you will find in the Margin of the
  inclo&#383;ed Paper. The &#383;ub&#383;tance of this &#383;hort Narrative
  I hope you will let Mon&#383;ieur <i>Zulichem</i> know, that he may be
  kept from expecting any thing of fini&#383;h'd in the Ob&#383;ervations,
  and be di&#383;pos'd to excu&#383;e the want of it. But &#383;uch as they
  are, I hope they will prove (without a Clinch) Luciferous Experiments, by
  &#383;etting the Speculations of the Curious on work, in a diligent
  Inquiry after the Nature of Light, towards the di&#383;covery of which,
  perhaps they have not yet met with &#383;o con&#383;iderable an
  Experiment, &#383;ince here we &#383;ee Light produc'd in a dead and
  opacous Body, and that not as in rotten Wood, or in Fi&#383;hes, or as in
  the <i>Bolonian</i> Stone, by a Natural Corruption, or by a <!-- Page 394
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394"></a>[pg 394]</span> Violent
  De&#383;truction of the Texture of the Body, but by &#383;o &#383;light a
  Mechanical operation upon its Texture, as we &#383;eem to know what it
  is, and as is immediately perform'd, and that &#383;everal wayes without
  at all prejudicing the Body, or making any &#383;en&#383;ible alterations
  in its Manife&#383;t Qualities. And I am the more willing to expo&#383;e
  my ha&#383;ty Tryals to Mon&#383;ieur <i>Zulichem</i>, and to You,
  becau&#383;e, he being upon the Con&#383;ideration of Dioptricks, &#383;o
  odd a <i>Ph&#339;nomemon</i> relateing to the Subject, as probably he treats
  of, Light will, I hope, excite a per&#383;on to con&#383;ider it, that is
  wont to con&#383;ider things he treats of very well. And for you Sir, I
  hope you will both recrute and perfect the Ob&#383;ervations you receive,
  For you know that I cannot add to them, having a good while &#383;ince
  re&#383;tor'd to Mr. <i>Clayton</i> the Stone, which though it be now in
  the hands of a Prince that &#383;o highly de&#383;erves, by
  under&#383;tanding them, the greate&#383;t Curio&#383;ities; yet he
  vouch&#383;afes you that acce&#383;s to him as keeps me from doubting,
  you may ea&#383;ily obtain leave to make further Tryals with it, of
  &#383;uch a Monarch as ours, that is not more inqui&#383;itive
  him&#383;elf, than a favourer of them that are &#383;o. I doubt not but
  the&#383;e Notes will put you in mind of the Motion you made to the
  Society, to impo&#383;e upon <!-- Page 395 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_395"></a>[pg 395]</span> me the Task of bringing in, what I
  had on other occa&#383;ions ob&#383;erv'd concerning &#383;hining Bodies.
  But though I deny not, that I &#383;ometimes made ob&#383;ervations about
  the <i>Bolonian</i> Stone, and try'd &#383;ome Experiments about
  &#383;ome other &#383;hining Bodies; Yet the &#383;ame Rea&#383;ons that
  reduc'd me then to be unwilling to receive ev'n their commands, mu&#383;t
  now be my Apology for not an&#383;wering your Expectations, Namely the
  ab&#383;tru&#383;e nature of Light, and my being already over-burden'd,
  and but too much kept imploy'd by the Urgency of the Pre&#383;s, as well
  as by more concerning and di&#383;tracting Occa&#383;ions. But yet I will
  tell you &#383;ome part of what I have met with in reference to the
  Stone, of which I &#383;end you an account. Becau&#383;e I find on the
  one &#383;ide, that a great many think it no Rarity upon a mi&#383;taken
  per&#383;wa&#383;ion, that not only there are &#383;tore of Carbuncles,
  of which this is one; but that all Diamonds and other Gli&#383;tering
  Jewels &#383;hine in the Dark. Whereas on the other &#383;ide there are
  very Learn'd Men, who (plau&#383;ibly enough) deny that there are any
  Carbuncles or &#383;hining Stones at all.</p>

  <p>And certainly, tho&#383;e Judicious men have much more to &#383;ay for
  them&#383;elves, than the others commonly Plead, and therefore did
  de&#383;ervedly look upon Mr. <i>Clayton</i>'s Diamond <!-- Page 396
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396"></a>[pg 396]</span> as a
  great Rarity. For not only <i>Boetius de Boot</i>, who is judg'd the
  be&#383;t Author on this Subject, a&#383;cribes no &#383;uch Virtue to
  Diamonds, but begins what he delivers of Carbuncles, with this
  pa&#383;&#383;age.<a name="NtA_26"></a><a href="#Nt_26"><sup>26</sup></a>
  <i>Magna fama est Carbunculi. Is vulgo putatur in tenebris Carbonis

  Diligent and Judicious <i>Johannes de Laet</i> in his Chapter of
  Carbuncles and of Rubies, has this pa&#383;&#383;age. <i>Quia autem
  Carbunculi, Pyropi &amp; Anthraces a veteribus nominantur, vulgo creditum

  recente&#383;t Writer I have met with on this Subject, <i>Olaus
  Wormius</i>, in his Account of his well furni&#383;h'd <i>Musæum</i>,
  do's, where he treats of Rubies, concurr with the former Writers by

  hearing of a Rubie, &#383;o very Vivid, that the Jewellers
  them&#383;elves have &#383;everal times begg'd leave of the fair Lady to
  whom it belong'd, that they might try their choice&#383;t Rubies by
  comparing them with That, I had the Opportunity by the Favour of this
  Lady and her Hu&#383;band, (both which I have the Honour to be acquainted
  with) to make a Trial of this famous Rubie in the Night, and in a Room
  well Darkn'd, but not only could not di&#383;cern any thing of Light, by
  looking on the Stone before any thing had been done to it, but could not
  by all my Rubbing bring it to afford the lea&#383;t Glimmering of
  Light.</p>

  <p>But, Sir, though I be very backward to admit &#383;trange things for
  truths, yet I am not very forward to reject them as
  impo&#383;&#383;ibilities, and therefore I would not di&#383;courage any
  from making further Inquiry, whether or no there be Really in <i>Rerum
  natura</i>, any &#383;uch thing as a true Carbuncle or Stone that without
  Rubbing will &#383;hine <!-- Page 398 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_398"></a>[pg 398]</span> in the Dark. For if &#383;uch a thing
  can be found, it may afford no &#383;mall A&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance to
  the Curious in the Inve&#383;tigation of Light, be&#383;ides the
  Noblene&#383;s and Rarity of the thing it &#383;elfe. And though
  <i>Vartomannus</i> was not an Eye witne&#383;s of what he relates, that
  the King of <i>Pegu</i>, one of the Chief Kings of the
  <i>East-Indies</i>, had a true Carbuncle of that Bigne&#383;s and
  Splendour, that it &#383;hin'd very Gloriou&#383;ly in the Dark, and
  though <i>Garcias ab Horto</i>, the <i>Indian</i> Vice-Roys
  Phy&#383;ician, &#383;peaks of another Carbuncle, only upon the Report of
  one, that he Di&#383;cours'd with, who affirmed him&#383;elf to have
  &#383;een it; yet as we are not &#383;ure that the&#383;e Men that gave
  them&#383;elves out to be Eye-witne&#383;&#383;es &#383;peak true, yet
  they may have done &#383;o for ought we know to the contrary. And I could
  pre&#383;ent you with a much con&#383;iderabler Te&#383;timony to the
  &#383;ame purpo&#383;e, if I had the permi&#383;&#383;ion of a
  Per&#383;on concern'd, without who&#383;e leave I mu&#383;t not do it. I
  might tell you that <i>Marcus Paulus Venetus</i><a name="NtA_28"></a><a
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>28</sup></a> (who&#383;e &#383;uppos'd Fables, divers
  of our later Travellours and Navigatours have &#383;ince found to be
  truths) &#383;peaking of the King of <i>Zeilan</i> that then was, tells
  us, that he was &#383;aid to have the be&#383;t Rubie in the World, a
  Palm long and as <!-- Page 399 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_399"></a>[pg 399]</span> big as a mans Arm, without &#383;pot,
  &#383;hining like a Fire, and he &#383;ubjoyns, that the Great
  <i>Cham</i>, under whom <i>Paulus</i> was a con&#383;iderable Officer,
  &#383;ent and offer'd the value of a City for it; But the King
  an&#383;wer'd, he would not give it for the trea&#383;ure of the World,
  nor part with it, having been his Ance&#383;tours. And I could add, that
  in the Relation made by two <i>Ru&#383;&#383;ian</i> Co&#383;&#383;acks
  of their Journey into <i>Catay</i><a name="NtA_29"></a><a
  href="#Nt_29"><sup>29</sup></a>, written to their Emperour, they
  mention'd their having been told by the people of tho&#383;e parts, that
  their King had a Stone, which Lights as the Sun both Day and Night,
  call'd in their Language <i>Sarra</i>, which tho&#383;e
  Co&#383;&#383;acks interpret a Ruby. But the&#383;e Relations are too
  uncertain for me to build any thing upon, and therefore I &#383;hall
  proceed to tell you, that there came hither about two years &#383;ince
  out of <i>America</i>, the Governour of one of the Principal Colonies
  there, an Ancient <i>Virtuo&#383;o</i>, and one that has the Honour to be
  a member of the Royal Society; this Gentleman finding &#383;ome of the
  chief Affairs of his Country committed to another and me, made me divers
  Vi&#383;its, and in one of them when I enquir'd what Rare Stones they had
  in tho&#383;e parts of the <i>Indies</i> he belong'd to, he told me, that
  the <i>Indians</i> had a Tradition <!-- Page 400 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400"></a>[pg 400]</span> that in a certain
  hardly acce&#383;&#383;ible Hill, a pretty way up in the Country, there
  was a Stone which in the Night time &#383;hin'd very vividly, and to a
  great di&#383;tance, and he a&#383;&#383;ur'd me, that though he thought
  it not fit to venture him&#383;elf &#383;o far among tho&#383;e Savages,
  yet he purpo&#383;ely &#383;ent thither a bold <i>Engli&#383;hman</i>,
  with &#383;ome Natives to be his guides, and that this
  Me&#383;&#383;enger brought him back word, that at a di&#383;tance from
  the Hillock he had plainly perceiv'd &#383;uch a &#383;hining
  Sub&#383;tance as the <i>Indians</i> Tradition mention'd, and being
  &#383;timulated by Curio&#383;ity, had &#383;lighted tho&#383;e
  Super&#383;titious Fears of the Inhabitants, and with much ado by
  rea&#383;on of the Difficulty of the way, had made a &#383;hift to
  clamber up to that part of the Hill, where, by a very heedful
  Ob&#383;ervation, he &#383;uppos'd him&#383;elf to have &#383;een the
  Light: but whether 'twere that he had mi&#383;taken the place, or for
  &#383;ome other Rea&#383;on, he could not find it there, though when he
  was return'd to his former Station, he did agen &#383;ee the Light
  &#383;hining in the &#383;ame place where it &#383;hone before. A further
  Account of this Light I expect from the Gentleman that gave me this, who
  lately &#383;ent me the news of his being landed in that Country. And
  though I re&#383;erve to my &#383;elf a full Liberty of Believing no more
  <!-- Page 401 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401"></a>[pg
  401]</span> than I &#383;ee cau&#383;e; yet I do the le&#383;s
  &#383;cruple to relate this, becau&#383;e a good part of it agrees well
  enough with another Story that I &#383;hall in the next place have
  occa&#383;ion to &#383;ubjoyn, in order whereunto I &#383;hall tell you,
  that though the Learned Authors I formerly mention'd, tell us, that no
  Writer has affirm'd his having him&#383;elf &#383;een a real Carbuncle,
  yet, con&#383;idering the Light of Mr. <i>Claytons</i> Diamond, it
  recall'd into my mind, that &#383;ome years before, when I was
  Inqui&#383;itive about Stones, I had met with an old <i>Italian</i> Book
  highly extoll'd to me by very competent Judges, and that though the Book
  were very &#383;carce, I had purchas'd it at a dear Rate, for the
  &#383;ake of a few con&#383;iderable pa&#383;&#383;ages I met with in it,
  and particularly one, which being very remarkable in it &#383;elf, and
  pertinent to our pre&#383;ent Argument, I &#383;hall put it for you,
  though not word for word, which I fear I have forgot to do, yet as to the
  Sen&#383;e, into <i>Engli&#383;h</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Having promis'd</i> (Says our Author)<a name="NtA_30"></a><a

  Carbuncle white, of that kind of whitene&#383;s which we &#383;aid was to
  be found in tho&#383;e Rubies of which we made mention a little
  above,</i> (where he had &#383;aid that tho&#383;e Rubies had a kind of
  Livid Whitene&#383;s or Palene&#383;s like that of a Calcidonian) <i>but
  it had in it a Lu&#383;tre &#383;o plea&#383;ing and &#383;o marveilous,

  though it be true, that in an exceeding Dark place I &#383;aw it
  &#383;hine in the manner of fire almo&#383;t gone out. But as for
  colour'd Carbuncles, it has not been my Fortune to have &#383;een any,
  wherefore I will onely &#383;et down what I Learn'd about them
  Di&#383;cour&#383;ing in my Youth with a</i> Roman <i>Gentleman of
  antient Experience in matters of Jewels, who told me, That one</i> Jacopo
  Cola <i>being by Night in a Vineyard of his, and e&#383;pying
  &#383;omething in the mid&#383;t of it, that &#383;hin'd like a

  place where he thought him&#383;elf to have &#383;een that fire, but not
  finding it, he &#383;aid, that being return'd to the &#383;ame place,
  whence he had fir&#383;t de&#383;cry'd it, and perceiving there the
  &#383;ame &#383;plendor as before, he mark'd it &#383;o heedfully, that
  he came at length to it, where he took up a very little Stone, which he
  carry'd away with Tran&#383;ports and Joy. And the next <!-- Page 403

  carrying it about to &#383;how it divers of his Friends, whil&#383;t he
  was relating after what manner he found it, there ca&#383;ually
  interven'd a <i>Venetian</i> Emba&#383;&#383;adour, exceedingly expert in
  Jewels, who pre&#383;ently knowing it to be a Carbuncle, did craftily
  before he and the &#383;aid <i>Jacopo</i> parted (&#383;o that there was
  no Body pre&#383;ent that under&#383;tood the Worth of &#383;o Precious a
  Gemm) purcha&#383;e it for the Value of 10. Crowns, and the next day left
  <i>Rome</i> to &#383;hun the being nece&#383;&#383;itated to re&#383;tore
  it, and (as he affirm'd) it was known within &#383;ome while after that
  the &#383;aid <i>Venetian</i> Gentleman did in <i>Con&#383;tantinople</i>
  &#383;ell that Carbuncle to the then Grand Seignior, newly come to the
  Empire, for a hundred thou&#383;and Crowns. <i>And this is what I can
  &#383;ay</i> concerning <i>Carbuncles</i>, and this is not a little at
  lea&#383;t as to the fir&#383;t part of this account, where our
  <i>Cellini</i> affirms him&#383;elf to have &#383;een a Real Carbuncle
  with his own Eyes, e&#383;pecially &#383;ince this Author appears wary in
  what he delivers, and is inclin'd rather to le&#383;&#383;en, than
  increa&#383;e the wonder of it. And his Te&#383;timony is the more
  con&#383;iderable, becau&#383;e though he were born a Subject neither to
  the Pope nor the then King of <i>France</i> (that Royal
  <i>Virtuo&#383;o</i> <i>Francis</i> the fir&#383;t) yet both the one and
  the other of tho&#383;e Princes imploy'd him much <!-- Page 404 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404"></a>[pg 404]</span> about making of
  their Noble&#383;t Jewels. What is now reported concerning a Shining
  Sub&#383;tance to be &#383;een in one of the I&#383;lands about
  <i>Scotland</i>, were very improper for me to mention to Sr. <i>Robert
  Morray</i>, to whom the fir&#383;t Information was Originally brought,
  and from whom I expect a farther (for I &#383;carce dare expect a
  convincing) account of it. But I mu&#383;t not omit that &#383;ome
  <i>Virtuo&#383;o</i> que&#383;tioning me the other day at
  <i>White-Hall</i> about Mr. <i>Claytons</i> Diamond, and meeting
  among&#383;t them an Ingenious <i>Dutch</i> Gentleman, who&#383;e Father
  was long Emba&#383;&#383;ador for the Netherlands in <i>England</i>, I
  Learn'd of him, that, he is acquainted with a per&#383;on, who&#383;e
  Name he told (but I do not well remember it) who was Admiral of the
  <i>Dutch</i> in the <i>Ea&#383;t-Indies</i>, and who a&#383;&#383;ur'd
  this Gentleman <i>Mon&#383;ieur Boreel</i>, that at his return from
  thence he brought back with him into <i>Holland</i> a Stone, which though
  it look'd but like a Pale Dull Diamond, &#383;uch as he &#383;aw Mr.
  <i>Claytons</i> to be, yet was it a Real Carbuncle, and did without
  rubbing &#383;hine &#383;o much, that when the Admiral had occa&#383;ion
  to open a Che&#383;t which he kept under Deck in a Dark place, where
  'twas forbidden to bring Candles for fear of Mi&#383;chances, as
  &#383;oon as he open'd the Trunck, the Stone <!-- Page 405 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405"></a>[pg 405]</span> would by its
  Native Light, &#383;hine &#383;o as to Illu&#383;trate a great part of
  it, and this Gentleman having very civilly and readily granted me the
  reque&#383;t I made him, to Write to the Admiral, who is yet alive in
  <i>Holland</i>, (and probably may &#383;till have the Jewel by him,) for
  a particular account of this Stone, I hope ere long to receive it, which
  will be the more welcome to me, not onely becau&#383;e &#383;o unlikely a
  thing needs a cleer evidence, but becau&#383;e I have had &#383;ome
  &#383;u&#383;pition of that (&#383;uppo&#383;ing the truth of the thing)
  what may be a &#383;hining Stone in a very hot Countrey as the
  <i>Ea&#383;t-Indies</i>, may perhaps cea&#383;e to be &#383;o (at
  lea&#383;t in certain &#383;ea&#383;ons,) in one as cold as
  <i>Holland</i>. For I ob&#383;erv'd in the Diamond I &#383;end you an
  account of, that not onely rubbing but a very moderate degree of warmth,
  though excited by other wayes, would make it &#383;hine a little. And
  'tis not impo&#383;&#383;ible that there may be Stones as much more
  &#383;u&#383;ceptible than that, of the Alterations requi&#383;ite to
  make a Diamond &#383;hine, as that appeares to be more
  &#383;u&#383;ceptible of them, than ordinary Diamonds. And I confe&#383;s
  to you, that this is not the only odd &#383;u&#383;pition (for they are
  not &#383;o much as conjectures) that what I try'd upon this Diamond
  &#383;ugge&#383;ted to me. For not here to entertain you with the <!--
  Page 406 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406"></a>[pg 406]</span>
  changes I think may be effected ev'n in harder &#383;orts of Stones, by
  wayes not vulgar, nor very promi&#383;ing, becau&#383;e I may
  el&#383;ewhere have occa&#383;ion to &#383;peak of them, and this Letter
  is but too Prolix already, that which I &#383;hall now acknowledge to you
  is, That I began to doubt whether there may not in &#383;ome Ca&#383;es
  be &#383;ome Truth in what is &#383;aid of the right Turquois, that it
  often changes Colour as the wearer is Sick or Well, and manife&#383;tly
  lo&#383;es its &#383;plendor at his Death. For when I found that ev'n the
  warmth of an Affriction that la&#383;ted not above a quarter of a minute,
  Nay, that of my Body, (who&#383;e Con&#383;titution you know is none of
  the hotte&#383;t) would make a manife&#383;t change in the
  &#383;olide&#383;t of Stones a Diamond, it &#383;eem'd not
  impo&#383;&#383;ible, that certain warm and Saline &#383;teams
  i&#383;&#383;uing from the Body of a living man, may by their plenty or
  paucity, or by their peculiar Nature, or by the total ab&#383;ence of
  them, diver&#383;ifie the Colour, and the &#383;plendor of &#383;o
  &#383;oft a Stone as the Turquois. And though I admir'd to &#383;ee, that
  I know not how many Men otherwi&#383;e Learn'd, &#383;hould confidently
  a&#383;cribe to Jewels &#383;uch Virtues as &#383;eem no way competible
  to Inanimate Agents, if to any Corporeal ones at all, yet as to what is
  affirm'd concerning the Turquois's <!-- Page 407 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407"></a>[pg 407]</span> changing Colour, I
  know not well how to reject the Affirmation of &#383;o Learned (and which
  in this ca&#383;e is much more con&#383;iderable) &#383;o Judicious a
  Lapidary as <i>Boetius de Boot</i><a name="NtA_31"></a><a
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>31</sup></a>, who upon his own particular and repeated
  Experience delivers &#383;o memorable <!-- Page 408 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408"></a>[pg 408]</span> a Narrative of the
  Turquois's changing Colour, that I cannot but think it worth your
  Peru&#383;al, e&#383;pecially &#383;ince a much later and very
  Experienc'd Author, <i>Olaus Wormius</i>,<a name="NtA_32"></a><a
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>32</sup></a> where he treats of that Stone, Confirms
  it with this Te&#383;timony. <i>Imprimis memorandum exemplum quod
  An&#383;helmus Boetius de &#383;eip&#383;o refert, tam mutati Coloris,
  quam à ca&#383;u pre&#383;ervationis. Cui &amp; ip&#383;e haud
  di&#383;&#383;imile adferre po&#383;sum, ni&#383;i ex An&#383;helmo
  petitum quis putaret.</i> I remember that I &#383;aw two or three years
  &#383;ince a <i>Turcois</i> (worn in a Ring) wherein there were &#383;ome
  &#383;mall &#383;pots, which the <i>Virtuo&#383;o</i> who&#383;e it was
  a&#383;ur'd me he had ob&#383;erv'd to grow &#383;ometimes greater
  &#383;ometimes le&#383;s, and to be &#383;ometimes in one part of the
  Stone, &#383;ometimes in another. And I having encourag'd to make
  Pictures from time to time of the Stone, and of the Situation of the
  cloudy parts, that&#383;o their Motion may be more indi&#383;putable, and
  better ob&#383;erv'd, he came to me about the midle of this very week,
  and a&#383;&#383;ur'd me that he had, as I wi&#383;h'd, made from time to
  time Schemes or Pictures of the differing parts of the Stone, whereby the
  &#383;everal Removes and motions of the above mentioned Clouds are very
  manife&#383;t, though the cau&#383;e &#383;eem'd to him very occult:
  the&#383;e Pictures <!-- Page 409 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_409"></a>[pg 409]</span> he has promis'd to &#383;how me, and
  is very ready to put the Stone it &#383;elf into my hands. But the ring
  having been the other day ca&#383;ually broken upon his finger,
  unle&#383;s it can be taken out, and &#383;et again without any
  con&#383;iderable heat, he is loath to have it medled with, for fear its
  peculiarity &#383;hould be thereby de&#383;troy'd. And po&#383;&#383;ibly
  his apprehen&#383;ion would have been &#383;trengthen'd, if I had had
  opportunity to tell him what is related by the Learned <i>Wormius</i><a
  name="NtA_33"></a><a href="#Nt_33"><sup>33</sup></a> of an acquaintance
  of his, that had a <i>Nephritick</i> &#383;tone, of who&#383;e eminent
  Virtues he had often Experience ev'n in him&#383;elf, and for that
  cau&#383;e wore it &#383;till about his Wri&#383;t; and yet going upon a
  time into a Bath of fair Water only, wherein certain Herbs had been
  boyl'd, the Stone by being wetted with this decoction, was depriv'd of
  all his Virtue, whence <i>Wormius</i> takes Occa&#383;ion to
  adverti&#383;e the &#383;ick, to lay by &#383;uch &#383;tones
  when&#383;oever they make u&#383;e of a Bath. And we might expect to find
  <i>Turcos</i> likewi&#383;e, ea&#383;ily to be wrought upon in point of
  Colour, if that were true, which the curious <i>Antonio Neri</i>, in his
  ingenious <i>Arte Vetraria</i><a name="NtA_34"></a><a
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>34</sup></a> teaches of it, namely, That <i>Turcois's
  di&#383;colour'd</i> and grown white, will regain and acquire <!-- Page
  410 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410"></a>[pg 410]</span> an
  excellent Colour, if you but keep them two or three days at mo&#383;t
  cover'd with Oyl of &#383;weet Almonds kept in a temperate heat by warm
  a&#383;hes, I &#383;ay if it were true, becau&#383;e I doubt whether it
  be &#383;o, and have not as yet had opportunity to &#383;atisfie my
  &#383;elf by Tryals, becau&#383;e I find by the confe&#383;&#383;ion of
  the mo&#383;t Skilfull Per&#383;ons among whom I have laid out for
  <i>Turcoi&#383;es</i>, that the true ones are great rarities, though
  others be not at all &#383;o. And therefore I &#383;hall now only mind
  you of one thing that you know as well as I, namely, that the rare Stone
  which is called <i>Oculus Mundi</i>, if it be good in its Kind, will have
  &#383;o great a change made in its Texture by being barely left a while
  in the Languide&#383;t of Liquors, common Waters, that from Opacous it
  will become Tran&#383;parent, and acquire a Lu&#383;tre of which it will
  again be depriv'd, without u&#383;ing any other Art or Violence, by
  leaving it a while in the Air. And before experience had &#383;atisfy'd
  us of the truth of this, it &#383;eem'd as unlikely that common Water or
  Air, &#383;hould work &#383;uch great changes in that Gemm, as it now
  &#383;eems that the Effluviums of a human Body &#383;hould effect
  le&#383;&#383;er changes in a <i>Turcois</i>, e&#383;pecially if more
  &#383;u&#383;ceptible of them, than other Stones of the &#383;ame kind.
  But both my Watch and my Eyes tell me that <!-- Page 411 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411"></a>[pg 411]</span> 'tis now high time
  to think of going to &#383;leep, matters of this Nature, will be better,
  as well as more ea&#383;ily, clear'd by Conference, than Writing. And
  therefore &#383;ince I think you know me too well to make it needfull for
  me to di&#383;clame Credulity, notwith&#383;tanding my having entertain'd
  you with all the&#383;e Extravagancies; for you know well, how wide a
  difference I am wont to put betwixt things that barely <i>may be</i>, and
  things that <i>are</i>, and between tho&#383;e Relations that are but not
  unworthy to be inquir'd into, and tho&#383;e that are not worthy to be
  actually believ'd; without making Apologies for my Ravings, I &#383;hall
  readily comply with the drow&#383;ine&#383;s that calls upon me to

<h2>OBSERVATIONS</h2>

  <p>Made this 27<sup>th</sup>.<a name="NtA_35"></a><a
  href="#Nt_35"><sup>35</sup></a> of <i>October</i> 1663. about Mr.
  <i>Clayton</i>'s Diamond.<a name="NtA_36"></a><a
  href="#Nt_36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

  <p>Being look'd on in the Day time, though in a Bed, who&#383;e Curtains
  were carefully drawn, I could not di&#383;cern it to Shine at all,
  though well Rubb'd, but about a little after Sun-&#383;et, whil&#383;t
  the Twilight yet la&#383;ted, Nay, this Morning<a name="NtA_37"></a><a
  href="#Nt_37"><sup>37</sup></a> a pretty while after Sun-ri&#383;ing,
  (but before I had been abroad in the more freely inlightned Air of the
  Chamber) I could upon a light Affriction ea&#383;ily perceive the Stone
  to Shine.</p>

<!-- Page 414 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414"></a>[pg 414]</span>

  <p>Secondly, The Candles being removed, I could not in a Dark place
  di&#383;cern the Stone to have any Light, when I looked on it, without
  having Rubb'd or otherwi&#383;e prepar'd it.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, By two white Pibbles though hard Rubb'd one again&#383;t
  another, nor by the long and vehement Affriction of Rock Cry&#383;tal
  again&#383;t a piece of Red cloath, nor yet by Rubbing two Diamonds
  &#383;et in Ring, as I had Rubb'd this Stone, I could produce any
  &#383;en&#383;ible degree of Light.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, I found this Diamond hard enough, not only to enable me to
  write readily with it upon Gla&#383;s, but to Grave on Rock Cry&#383;tal
  it &#383;elf.</p>

  <p>Fifthly, I found this to have like other Diamonds, an Electrical
  faculty.<a name="NtA_38"></a><a href="#Nt_38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sixthly, Being rubb'd upon my Cloaths, as is u&#383;ual for the
  exciting of Amber, Wax, and other Electrical Bodies, it did in the Dark
  manife&#383;tly &#383;hine like Rotten Wood, or the Scales of Whitings,
  or other putrified Fi&#383;h.</p>

  <p>Seventhly, But this Con&#383;picuou&#383;ne&#383;s was Fainter than
  that of the Scales, and Slabber (if I may &#383;o call it) of Whitings,
  and much Fainter than the Light of a Glow-worm, by <!-- Page 415 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415"></a>[pg 415]</span> which I have been
  &#383;ometimes able to Read a &#383;hort Word, whereas after an ordinary
  Affriction of this Diamond I was not able to di&#383;cern di&#383;tinctly
  by the Light of it any of the neare&#383;t Bodies: And this Glimmering
  al&#383;o did very manife&#383;tly and con&#383;iderably Decay
  pre&#383;ently upon the cea&#383;ing of the Affriction, though the Stone
  continued Vi&#383;ible &#383;ome while after.</p>

  <p>Eighthly, But if it were Rubb'd upon a convenient Body for a pretty
  while, and Briskly enough, I found the Light would be for &#383;ome
  moments much more con&#383;iderable, almo&#383;t like the Light of a
  Glow-worm, in&#383;omuch after I cea&#383;ed Rubbing, I could with the
  Chaf'd &#383;tone exhibit a little Luminous Circle, like that, but not
  &#383;o bright as that which Children make by moving a &#383;tick Fir'd
  at the end, and in this ca&#383;e it would continue Vi&#383;ible about
  &#383;even or eight times as long as I had been in Rubbing it.</p>

  <p>Ninthly, I found that holding it a while near<a name="NtA_39"></a><a
  href="#Nt_39"><sup>39</sup></a> the Flame of a Candle, (from which yet I
  was carefull to avert my Eyes) and <!-- Page 416 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416"></a>[pg 416]</span> being immediately
  remov'd into the Dark, it di&#383;clo&#383;ed &#383;ome faint Glimmering,
  but inferiour to that, it was wont to acquire by Rubbing. And afterward
  holding it near a Fire that had but little Flame, I found the Stone to be
  rather le&#383;s than more excited, than it had been by the Candle.</p>

  <p>Tenthly, I likewi&#383;e indeavour'd to make it Shine, by holding it a
  pretty while in a very Dark place, over a thick piece of Iron, that was
  well Heated, but not to that Degree as to be Vi&#383;ibly &#383;o. And
  though at length I found, that by this way al&#383;o, the Stone acquired
  &#383;ome Glimmering, yet it was le&#383;s than by either of the other
  ways above mention'd.</p>

  <p>Eleventhly, I al&#383;o brought it to &#383;ome kind of Glimmering
  Light, by taking it into Bed with me, and holding it a good while upon a
  warm part of my Naked Body.</p>

  <p>Twelfthly, To &#383;atisfie my &#383;elf, whether the Motion
  introduc'd into the Stone did generate the Light upon the account of its
  producing Heat there, I held it near the Flame of a Candle, till it was
  qualify'd to &#383;hine pretty well in the Dark, and then immediately I
  apply'd a &#383;lender Hair to try whether it would attract it, but found
  not that it did &#383;o; though if it were made to <!-- Page 417 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417"></a>[pg 417]</span> &#383;hine by
  Rubbing, it was as I formerly noted Electrical. And for further
  Confirmation, though I once purpo&#383;edly kept it &#383;o near the hot
  Iron I ju&#383;t now mention'd, as to make it &#383;en&#383;ibly Warm,
  yet it &#383;hin'd more Dimly than it had done by Affriction or the Flame
  of a Candle, though by both tho&#383;e ways it had not acquir'd any
  warmth that was &#383;en&#383;ible.</p>

  <p>Thirteenthly, Having purpo&#383;ely rubb'd it upon &#383;everal Bodies
  differing as to Colour, and as to Texture, there &#383;eem'd to be
  &#383;ome little Di&#383;parity in the excitation (if I may &#383;o call
  it) of Light. Upon White and Red Cloths it &#383;eem'd to &#383;ucceed
  be&#383;t, e&#383;pecially in compari&#383;on of Black ones.</p>

  <p>Fourteenthly, But to try what it would do rubb'd upon Bodies more
  hard, and le&#383;s apt to yield Heat upon a light Affriction, than
  Cloath, I fir&#383;t rubb'd it upon a white wooden Box, by which it was
  excited, and afterwards upon a piece of purely Glazed Earth, which
  &#383;eem'd during the Attrition to make it Shine better than any of the
  other Bodies had done, without excepting the White ones, which I add,
  le&#383;t the Effect &#383;hould be wholly a&#383;crib'd to the
  di&#383;po&#383;ition White Bodies are wont to have to Reflect much
  Light.</p>

<!-- Page 418 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418"></a>[pg 418]</span>

  <p>Fifteenthly, Having well excited the Stone, I nimbly plung'd it under
  Water<a name="NtA_40"></a><a href="#Nt_40"><sup>40</sup></a>, that I had
  provided for that purpo&#383;e, and perceiv'd it to Shine whil&#383;t it
  was beneath the Surface of that Liquor, and this I did divers times. But
  when I indeavour'd to produce a Light by rubbing it upon the lately
  mentioned Cover of the Box, the Stone and it being both held beneath the
  Surface of the Water, I did not well &#383;atisfie my &#383;elf in the
  Event of the Trial; But this I found, if I took the Stone out, and Rubb'd
  it upon a piece of Cloath, it would not as el&#383;e it was wont to do,
  pre&#383;ently acquire a Luminou&#383;ne&#383;s, but needed to be rubb'd
  manife&#383;tly much longer before the de&#383;ired Effect was found.</p>

  <p>Sixteenthly, I al&#383;o try'd &#383;everal times, that by covering it
  with my <!-- Page 419 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419"></a>[pg
  419]</span> warm Spittle (having no warm Water at hand) it did not
  lo&#383;e his Light.<a name="NtA_41"></a><a
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

  <p>Seventeenthly, Finding that by Rubbing the Stone with the Flat
  &#383;ide downwards, I did by rea&#383;on of the Opacity of the Ring; and
  the &#383;udden Decay of Light upon the cea&#383;ing of the Attrition,
  probably lo&#383;e the &#383;ight of the Stones greate&#383;t
  Vividne&#383;s; and &#383;uppo&#383;ing that the Commotion made in one
  part of the &#383;tone will be ea&#383;ily propagated all over, I
  &#383;ometimes held the piece of Cloath upon which I rubb'd it, &#383;o,
  that one &#383;ide of the Stone was expo&#383;ed to my Eye, whil&#383;t I
  was rubbing the other, whereby it appear'd more Vivid than formerly, and
  to make Luminous Tracts by its Motions too and fro. And &#383;ometimes
  holding the Stone upwards, I rubb'd its Broad &#383;ide with a fine
  &#383;mooth piece of Tran&#383;parent Horn, by which means the Light
  through that Diaphanous Sub&#383;tance, did whil&#383;t I was actually
  rubbing the Stone, appear &#383;o Brisk that &#383;ometimes and in
  &#383;ome places it &#383;eem'd to have little Sparks of fire.</p>

  <p>Eighteenthly, I took al&#383;o a piece of flat Blew Gla&#383;s, and
  having rubb'd the Diamond well upon a Cloath, and nimbly clapt the
  Gla&#383;s upon it, to try whether in ca&#383;e the Light could peirce
  it, it would by <!-- Page 420 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_420"></a>[pg 420]</span> appearing Green, or of &#383;ome
  other Colour than Blew, a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t me to gue&#383;s whether it
  &#383;elf were &#383;incere or no. But finding the Gla&#383;s impervious
  to &#383;o faint a Light, I then thought it fit to try whether that hard
  Bodies would not by Attrition increa&#383;e the Diamonds Light &#383;o as
  to become penetrable thereby, and accordingly when I rubb'd the
  Gla&#383;s briskly upon the Stone, I found the Light to be
  Con&#383;picuous enough, and &#383;omewhat Dy'd in its pa&#383;&#383;age,
  but found it not ea&#383;ie to give a Name to the Colour it
  exhibited.</p>

  <p>La&#383;tly, To comply with the Su&#383;pition I had upon the whole
  Matter, that the chief manife&#383;t Change wrought in the Stone, was by
  Compre&#383;&#383;ion of its parts, rather than Incale&#383;cence, I took
  a piece of white Tile well Glaz'd, and if I pre&#383;s'd the Stone hard
  again&#383;t it, it &#383;eem'd though I did not rub it to and fro, to
  &#383;hine at the Sides: And however it did both very manife&#383;tly and
  vigorou&#383;ly Shine, if whil&#383;t I &#383;o pre&#383;s'd it, I mov'd
  it any way upon the Surface of the Tile, though I did not make it draw a
  Line of above a quarter of an Inch long, or thereabouts. And though I
  made it not move to and fro, but only from one end of the &#383;hort Line
  to the other, without any return or Lateral motion. Nay, after it had
  been <!-- Page 421 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421"></a>[pg
  421]</span> often rubb'd, and &#383;uffer'd to lo&#383;e its Light again,
  not only it &#383;eem'd more ea&#383;ie to be excited than at the
  beginning of the Night; but if I did pre&#383;s hard upon it with my
  Finger, at the very in&#383;tant that I drew it briskly off, it would
  di&#383;clo&#383;e a very Vivid but exceeding &#383;hort Liv'd Splendour,
  not to call it a little Coru&#383;cation.<a name="NtA_42"></a><a
  href="#Nt_42"><sup>42</sup></a> So that a <i>Carte&#383;ian</i> would
  &#383;carce &#383;cruple to think he had found in this Stone no
  &#383;light Confirmation of his Ingenious Ma&#383;ters
  <i>Hypothe&#383;is</i>, touching the Generation of Light in Sublunary
  Bodies, not &#383;en&#383;ibly Hot.</p>

<h2>A Po&#383;t&#383;cript.</h2>

<h3>Annexed &#383;ome Hours after the<br />
Ob&#383;ervations were Written.</h3>

  <p><i>So many particulars taken notice of in one Night, may make this
  Stone appear a kind of Prodigie, and the rather, becau&#383;e having
  try'd as I formerly noted, not only a fine Artificial Cry&#383;tal, and
  &#383;ome al&#383;o that is Natural, but a Ruby and two Diamonds, I did
  not find that any of the&#383;e di&#383;clos'd the like Glimmering of
  <!-- Page 423 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423"></a>[pg
  423]</span> Light;<a name="NtA_43"></a><a href="#Nt_43"><sup>43</sup></a>
  yet after all, perceiving by the Hardne&#383;s, and the Te&#383;timony of
  a Skilfull Gold&#383;mith, that this was rather a Natural than Artificial
  Stone; for fear le&#383;t there might be &#383;ome difference in the way
  of Setting, or in the &#383;hape of the Diamonds I made u&#383;e of,
  neither of which was like this, a flat Table-&#383;tone, I thought fit to
  make a farther Trial of my own Diamonds, by &#383;uch a brisk and
  a&#383;&#383;iduous Affriction as might make amends for the
  Di&#383;advantages above-mention'd, in ca&#383;e they were the cau&#383;e
  of the un&#383;ucce&#383;sfulne&#383;s of the former Attempts: And
  accordingly I found, that by this way I could ea&#383;ily bring a Diamond
  I wore on my Finger to di&#383;clo&#383;e a Light, that was
  &#383;en&#383;ible enough, and continued &#383;o though I cover'd it with
  Spittle, and us'd &#383;ome other trials about it. And this will much
  le&#383;&#383;en the wonder of all the formerly mention'd
  Ob&#383;ervations, by &#383;hewing that the properties that are &#383;o
  &#383;trange are not peculiar to one Diamond, but may be found in others
  al&#383;o, and perhaps in divers other hard and</i> Diaphanous <i>Stones.
  Yet I hope that what this Di&#383;covery takes away from the Wonder of
  the&#383;e Ob&#383;ervations, it will add to the
  In&#383;tructivene&#383;s of them, by affording pregnants Hints, towards
  the Inve&#383;tigation of the Nature of Light.</i></p>

Domino habuerat emerent) &#383;ibi emptam voluit, pri&#383;tinum enim 
nitorem &amp; Colorem pror&#383;us ami&#383;erat, ut potius Malachites,

etiam parens &amp; frater meus, qui antea sæpius gratiam &amp; elegantiam 
ip&#383;ius viderant, mirabundi eam nunc tam e&#383;&#383;e deformem, Emit
eam nihilominus pater, &#383;ati&#383;que vili pretio, qua omnibus 
contemptui erat, ac pre&#383;entes non eam e&#383;&#383;e quam 
Hi&#383;panus ge&#383;tarat, arbitrarentur. Domum rever&#383;us Pater, 
qui tam turpem Gemmam ge&#383;tare &#383;ibi indecorum putabat, eam mihi
dono dat, inquiens; Quandoquidem, fili mi, vulgi fama e&#383;t, Turcoidem,
ut facultates &#383;uas exercere po&#383;&#383;it, dono dari debere tibi 
eam devoveo, ego acceptam Gemmam &#383;culptori trado, at gentilitia mea 
in&#383;ignia illi, quamadmodum fieri &#383;olet, in Ja&#383;pide 
Chalcedono, alii&#383;que Ignobilioribus Gemmis, in&#383;culperat. Turpe 
enim exi&#383;timabam, huju&#383;modi Gemmâ ornatus gratia, dum gratiam 
nullam haberet, uti. Paret Sculptor redditque Gemmam, quam ge&#383;to pro
annulo Signatorio. Vix per men&#383;em ge&#383;taram, redit illi 
pri&#383;tinus color, &#383;ed non ita nitens propter Sculpturam, ac 
inæqualem &#383;uperficiem. Miramur omnes gemmam, atque id præcipuè quod
color indies pulchrior fieret. Id quià ob&#383;ervabam, nunquam fere eam

it &#383;elf being to be &#383;hown to the Royal Society, when the 
Ob&#383;ervations were deliver'd, I was willing (being in ha&#383;te) 
to omit the De&#383;cription of it, which is in &#383;hort, That it was
a Flat or Table Diamond, of about a third part of an Inch in length, and
&#383;omewhat le&#383;s in breadth, that it was a Dull Stone, and of a 
very bad Water, having in the Day time very little of the Vividne&#383;s
of ev'n ordinary Diamonds, and being Blemi&#383;hed with a whiti&#383;h
Cloud about the middle of it, which covered near a third part of the 
Stone.</i></p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_37"></a><a href="#NtA_37">37</a> <i>Ha&#383;t 
made me forget to take notice that I went abroad the &#383;ame Morning, the

and e&#383;pecially of the whiti&#383;h Cloud that po&#383;&#383;e&#383;t 
a good part of it. But for all my attention I could not di&#383;cover any 
peculiarity worth mentioning.</i></p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_39"></a><a href="#NtA_39">39</a> IX. <i>We 
dur&#383;t not hold it in the Flame of a Candle, no more than put it into 
a naked Fire; For fear too Violent a Heat (which has been ob&#383;erv'd 
to &#383;poil many other precious Stones) &#383;hould vitiate and impair 
a Jewel, that was but borrow'd, and was &#383;uppos'd to be the only one 
of its Kind.</i></p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_40"></a><a href="#NtA_40">40</a> XV. <i>We 
likewi&#383;e Plung'd it as &#383;oon as we had excited it, under Liquors 
of &#383;everal &#383;orts, as Spirit of Wine, Oyl both Chymical and 
expre&#383;s'd, an Acid Spirit, and as I remember an Alcalizate Solution, 
and found not any of tho&#383;e various Liquors to de&#383;troy its 
Shining property.</i></p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_41"></a><a href="#NtA_41">41</a> XVI. 
<i>Having found by this Ob&#383;ervation, that a warm Liquor would not 
extingui&#383;h Light in the Diamond, I thought fit to try, whether by 
rea&#383;on of its warmth it would not excite it, and divers times I found,
that if it were kept therein, till the Water had lei&#383;ure to 
communicate &#383;ome of its Heat to it, it would often &#383;hine as 
&#383;oon as it was taken out, and probably we &#383;hould have &#383;een
it Shine more, whil&#383;t it was in the Water, if &#383;ome degree of 
Opacity which heated Water is wont to acquire, upon the &#383;core of the
Numerous little Bubbles generated in it, had not kept us from 
di&#383;cerning the Lu&#383;tre of the Stone.</i></p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_42"></a><a href="#NtA_42">42</a> <i>I after
bethought my &#383;elf of imploying a way, which produc'd the 
de&#383;ir'd Effect both &#383;ooner and better. For holding betwixt
my Fingers a Steel Bodkin, near the Lower part of it, I pre&#383;s'd
the point hard again&#383;t the Surface of the Diamond, and much more
if I &#383;truck the point again&#383;t it, the Coru&#383;cation would
be extremely &#383;uddain, and very Vivid, though very Vani&#383;hing
too, and this way which commonly much &#383;urpris'd and pleas'd the
Spectators, &#383;eem'd far more proper than the other, to &#383;how that
pre&#383;&#383;ure alone, if forcible enough, though it were &#383;o 
&#383;uddain, and &#383;hort, that it could not well be &#383;uppos'd to
give the Stone any thing near a &#383;en&#383;ible degree of Warmth, as
may be &#383;u&#383;pected of Rubbing, yet 'tis &#383;ufficient to 
generate a very Vivid Light.</i></p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_43"></a><a href="#NtA_43">43</a> We afterwards,
try'd precious Stones, as Diamonds, Rubies, Saphires, and Emeralls, &amp;c.
but found not any of them to Shine except &#383;ome Diamonds, and of 
the&#383;e we were not upon &#383;o little practice, able to fore-tell 
before hand, which would be brought to Shine, and which would not; For 
&#383;everal very good Diamonds, either would not Shine at all, or much
le&#383;s than others that were farr inferiour to them. And yet 
tho&#383;e Ingenious Men are mi&#383;taken, that think a Diamond mu&#383;t
be foul and cloudy, as Mr. <i>Claytons</i> was, to be fit for Shining; for
as we could bring &#383;ome &#383;uch to afford a Glimmering Light, 
&#383;o with &#383;ome clear and excellent Diamonds, we could do the like.
But none of tho&#383;e many that we try'd of all Kinds, were equal to the
Diamond on which the Ob&#383;ervations were made, not only con&#383;idering
the degree of Light it afforded, but the ea&#383;ine&#383;s wherewith it 
was excited, and the Comparatively great duration of its Shining.</p>
